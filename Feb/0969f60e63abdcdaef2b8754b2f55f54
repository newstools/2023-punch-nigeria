Animasahun Salman Sokoto The Amalgamated Union of Northern Traders has endorsed a directive by Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State that security men should arrest anybody who rejects old naira notes during transactions. The traders made their position on the matter known during a press conference in Sokoto State. The PUNCH reports that Matawalle and his Kogi and Kaduna state counterparts dragged the Federal Government to the Supreme Court seeking an order to extend the validity of the old N200, N500 and N1000 notes. The Supreme Court, in its ruling on Wednesday, stopped the CBN from implementing the February 10 deadline for the validity of the old notes as legal tender. The group’s youth leader, Alhaji Sanusi Nufawa, noted that the informal sector could only be revived if leaders took drastic decisions to make people do transactions with both old and new notes just like Matawalle noted. He said the effort would further reduce and relieve the pains that ordinary Nigerians are experiencing in the face of scarcity of both the old and new naira notes. He expressed optimism that the circulation of old notes and gradual withdrawal and replacement of old with new notes would ease people’s sufferings. According to him, he was convinced that those against Matawalle’s action and victory at the Supreme Court are either misguided or blinded by political chauvinism. The trader leader further commended the governor for openly standing behind his people than becoming a burden like others doing now; using the suffering for political gains. He also commended the National Council of State in their resolution to the government on producing more naira notes and considering people’s plights.
