Al Nassr star player Cristiano Ronaldo has finally put his name on the scoresheet of the Arabian club after scoring a penalty in a 2-2 draw with Al Fateh. Ronaldo however, missed a huge scoring chance during the first half of the game as Al Nassr lagged one goal behind until the Portuguese star’s late penalty levelled the game for his side. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner hadn’t scored in his two previous appearances, despite scoring twice against PSG for an all-star team in a prestigious friendly earlier in January. Ronaldo had yet to score for his new club, failing to find the back of the net on his league debut against Al Ettifaq or in Al Nassr’s Saudi Super Cup exit to Al Ittihad. However, after helping his club steal a point from the home side today, Al Nassr are now top of the standings after 15 games, level on 34 points with second-placed Al Shabab but with a match in hand. They next travel to Al Wedha on Thursday. The Portugal captain had his contract with Manchester United  terminated by mutual consent in November last year, following an explosive interview with British broadcaster, Piers Morgan, where he heavily criticised the management of the club and manager Erik ten Hag before making a big-money move to the Saudi Pro League on a two-year deal.
