The Assistant Inspector General of Police in charge of 2023 elections in zone 12 comprising Bauchi and Gombe states, Yahaya Abubakar, says the Force would not be dragged to the misconduct of officers, adding that they are on their own. Abubakar who is AIG in charge of zone 15 comprising Maiduguri and Yobe states, made this disclosure in Gombe State Police Command during a sensitisation on Saturday’s election. According to him, officers should refrain from drawing the Force’s name in the mud, stressing that they would be sacrificed instead of being allowed to smear its operations. The AIG disclosed that the election remained a process of monitoring the integrity of the Force, urging them not to misuse the opportunity. He said, “Any evidence to state that a police officer has shown bias or prejudice over a party and another has the potentiality to undermine the entire process. “Such conduct will constitute a disciplinary offence capable of investigation and sanctions once it is documented that any of you is involved, you will stand the risk of being investigated and sanctions will be taken against you. “We need to cleanse ourselves, first of all, we will deal with you drop you outside and tell them, you are not part of us so that we can protect ourselves. Instead of the entire organisation going down we will rather sacrifice you alone. How many are we almost 400,000 how can you jeopardise the entire organisation for one person.” He also warned against the unnecessary application of force, and familiarity during the electioneering process, adding that people are watching, “there are those there to assess you. “It is unlawful for a police officer to use force on voters. Such excessive use of force is capable of driving away potential voters,” he added. Also speaking, the state Commissioner of Police, Oqua Etim, lauded the commitment of the media, civil society organisations and political parties ahead of the smooth conduct of the 2023 elections.
