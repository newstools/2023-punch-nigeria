A civil society organisation, One Nigeria Group, has called on separatist agitators to allow elections to be held peacefully in their regions. Addressing journalists in Abuja on Wednesday, the President of the group, Muhammad Hassan, said the country’s integrity was at stake concerning the election. The Indigenous People of Biafra had severally threatened that elections would not hold in the South-East. Similarly, the Inspector General Police, Usman Baba while speaking at a strategic meeting held with Command Police Commissioners, Zonal AIGs and Deputy Inspectors General of Police revealed that the Oduduwa Nation agitators had been amassing weapons and mobilising resources to disrupt the polls. Hassan urged security agencies not to leave any stone unturned and ensure the elections are held in a safe environment. He said, ” We call on separatist movements and agitators, particularly the Yoruba Nation and IPOB, to sheath their swords and allow peace to reign as we go out to elect our leaders again. “As it were, Nigeria is currently in the eyes of the storm across the world because the election has a global event colouration. Therefore, the government at all levels must guarantee peace and security as well as a credible exercise to be able to sustain the country’s integrity and her African giant status in the comity of nations. “Based on the security assurances given us by security agencies, Nigerians should not panic but come out en masse to perform this civic responsibility to determine their fate in this democratic dispensation.” He also said the group has decided to support the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, adding that if elected, he would unify the country, putting an end to the various secession agitations witnessed under the All Progressives Congress.
