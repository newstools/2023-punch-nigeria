The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has said Nigeria is willing to support Turkey and Syria “in any way possible,” as the death toll of the earthquake that hit parts of the countries nears 1,800. This was as he commiserated with the governments and people of Turkey and Syria, and those who lost family and friends in the devastating earthquake in the southern Turkish city of Gaziantep. Buhari revealed this in a statement signed Monday by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, titled ‘Deadly Earthquake: President Buhari commiserates with Turkey, Syria pledges support.’ In the early hours of Monday, a 7.8-magnitude quake hit the town of Pazarcik, near Gaziantep, a border community with Syria. The region is home to millions of Turkish citizens, displaced Syrians and refugees. Aljazeera reports that the initial quake was followed by a series of aftershocks and then a 7.5-magnitude quake in the afternoon which drove the death toll to almost 1,800 people with dozens of buildings destroyed. Turkey’s disaster and emergency management authority confirmed that the earthquake struck at 4:17 a.m. local time, in what has been described as the country’s most seismic occurrence in years. Reacting to the incident, the President said Nigeria is open to fully support “in any way possible.” “The President wishes those injured a speedy recovery and assures that the prayers and thoughts of Nigerians are with the many affected by this severe disaster and its aftershocks. “As a steadfast friend to Turkey and Syria, President Buhari says Nigeria is ready to offer its full support in any way possible,” the statement read.
