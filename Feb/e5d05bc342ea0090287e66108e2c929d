The Lagos State Government has urged residents to create retention and storage amenities in their homes to help in flood management across the state. According to a statement on Sunday, the Permanent Secretary, Office of Drainage Services and Water Resources, Lekan Shodeinde, stated this during a stakeholders’ forum on the adaptation of a Sustainable Urban Drainage System in Alausa, Ikeja. Shodeinde said, “There is a need for a drainage infrastructure master plan to combat the problem of flooding in Lagos. We urge Lagosians to create retention and storage amenities in their homes for storage of stormwater to assist in containing flooding in the state. “These storage facilities will serve as reservoirs for harvesting stormwater at the peak of the rainy season for later domestic use or slow discharge into the drains after rainfall. “The ministry in synergy with other stakeholders and professional bodies in the building sector will guarantee there is a change in the construction methodology and approval process and this will ensure the creation of rainwater storage facilities in each compound.” On his part, the Chairman, House Committee on the Environment, Rotimi Abiru, called for improved synergy and stakeholders’ involvement to achieve a proper model city master plan.
