Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina State has identified security challenges as the major factor responsible for low performance in the areas of infrastructural development by governors in the North West. Masari spoke in Katsina, the state capital on Saturday when members of Federal Government Implementation Monitoring Committee on projects executed in the state paid him a courtesy visit. The governor said state governments in the region were committing huge amount of money for logistic support to security agencies and local vigilante groups battling bandits in the region. He said, â€œWe in the North-West face many problems of insecurity, including banditry, and this had negative impact on our performance. Although, we tried as much as possible to perform well generally, the issue of insecurity affected us. Masari maintained that his administration had a comprehensive record of its expenditure on the projects executed, infrastructural development and on security from 2015 to date.
