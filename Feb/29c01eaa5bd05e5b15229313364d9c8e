The Association of Senior Staff of Banks, Insurance and Financial Institutions has revealed that banks have lost the sum of N5 billion across the nation, following recent attacks and destruction of bank facilities. The President of ASSBIFI, Oluwole Olusoji, disclosed this on Thursday at a news conference in Lagos. He said aside from bank buildings burnt and Automated Teller Machines destroyed, bank officials were also affected. Olusoji said 17 bank branches have been attacked so far. It will be recalled that several commercial institutions were destroyed by protesters across the country, following the scarcity of naira notes. Olusoji said, “Notwithstanding the insecurity due to the destruction of business premises within the banking industry, and the impact on insurance organisations, we remain committed to go the extra mile in providing service to our customers in safe and secure environments. “However, we value the lives of our members and colleagues and will not put them at any further risk. We have, therefore, put them on alert and shall instruct them without further warning to immediately stay away from their branches if these attacks on our members and facilities continue until such a time that they can be guaranteed of their personal safety and the security of their workplaces by the relevant authorities. “We call on the public to desist from threatening or attacking our members, or destroying our properties as they will be only proverbially cutting their noses to spite their faces. We can only give what we have been provided with and nothing more,” Olusoji said.
