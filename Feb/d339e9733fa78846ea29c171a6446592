The Independent National Electoral Commission, on Tuesday, declared the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Simon Mwadkwon as the winner for the Plateau-North senatorial district election held last Saturday. The commission also declared the PDP candidate, Musa Agah as the winner for Bassa/Jos North Federal Constituency seat. The Returning Officer for Plateau North senatorial election and the Head of English Department, University of Jos, Professor Jeff Doki, announced the results. He announced that Mwadkwon polled 155 ,681 votes to defeat the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Christopher Musa who polled 78,302. The candidate of the Peoples Redemption Party, Suleiman Kwande polled 32,607 votes. For the Bassa/Jos North federal  constituency seat, the Returning Officer, Professor Josiah Muthir of the University of Jos declared the results of the election. According to him, the PDP candidate scored 87,609 to win the election while his closest rival, Hon Muhammad Alkali of the PRP polled 67, 331. The PUNCH reports that the announcement of the winners  for Plateau North senatorial election and that of the Bassa/Jos North Federal Constituency was originally meant to be announced at the Jos North Local Government Secretariat, where the Collation Center for the two elections was situated. However, there was tension at the secretariat over the invasion of the collation center by thugs alleged to be loyal to the PRP candidates. The thugs  had earlier chased the INEC officials out of the collation centre, a development which made the electoral body move the centre to another location. The election results were announced in the Tudun Wada community of the state.
