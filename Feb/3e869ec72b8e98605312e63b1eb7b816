Manchester United and Chelsea are both keen on signing Napoli striker Victor Osimhen next summer and may have to out-spend Paris Saint-Germain to get their man, according to the Sun. The paper writes, “They would be prepared to break the British transfer record of £107m they have just set for Enzo Fernandez in order to land Osimhen. “The striker, 24, is set to be one of the most in-demand players in the next transfer window. “Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain are among the clubs also in the hunt for Osimhen, whose 14 goals in 16 Serie A games have sent Napoli to the top of the table. “The Italian giants don’t want to lose their star man but are confident of generating a high-stakes auction for a player who will have two years left on his contract in the summer.”
