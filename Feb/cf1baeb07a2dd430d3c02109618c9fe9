The Ministry of Interior has published the names of 8, 611 Nigerians who have yet to collect their  passports across the country. The ministry listed the names on its website with the link shared on its official Twitter handle and retweeted by the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, on Thursday. PUNCH had earlier reported that the Nigeria Immigration Service said over 148,000 passports were awaiting collection nationwide since 2020. The NIS Public Relations Officer, Anthony Akuneme, also noted that the NIS could not reach the owners, some of who had incorrect contact details at the point of registration. He revealed that the Comptroller-General, Isa Idris, had deployed a team of senior officers nationwide to reach the owners of the abandoned passports. “If you find your name, proceed to the passport office to pick up yours,” the ministry said in the tweet.
