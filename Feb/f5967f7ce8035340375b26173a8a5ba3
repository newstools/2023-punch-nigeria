The Commissioner of Police, Abia State Command, CP Mustapha Mohammed Bala, has reiterated the IGP’s order on movements and called on all Abians to comply strictly. In a statement by the state Police Public Relations Officer, Geoffrey Ogbonna, the command listed the order to include, “restriction of vehicular movements, ban on security escorts of VIPs to the polls, non-participation of state security outfits on the election security management and unauthorised use of sirens, covered number plates and tinted glasses.” According to the command, “Only those on essential duties such as INEC officials, electoral observers, ambulances responding to medical emergencies, fire-fighters, etc are exempted from restriction on vehicular movements.” The command further warned, “All security escorts and aides attached to VIPs and politicians are sternly warned not to accompany their principals to polling units/ collation centres.” The order, which is part of measures emplaced to ensure a safe, secure, and conducive environment for the conduct of elections, the command said is “aimed at ensuring public order management, the safety of electorates, as well as assisting the security agencies in effective policing, thereby preventing hoodlums and criminally-minded elements from disrupting the electoral process.” The CP further warned “anyone found flouting this directive will be severely sanctioned” and emphasised that only security personnel specifically assigned to election duties are to be seen within and around the designated election booths and centres.” While empathising with well-meaning citizens on the inconveniences the restriction may cause, the CP urged all active electorates to be law-abiding and turn out en masse to exercise their franchise. “Shun vote buying, vote selling, hate speech, misinformation, and disinformation, snatching of ballot boxes, and other criminal act(s) as the Force and other security agencies will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that all violators of extant laws, most especially the Electoral Act 2022 (as amended), are brought to book”, the CP further warned.
