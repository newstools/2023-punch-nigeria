The Ebeano political family in Enugu State has described as ‘spurious and ridiculous’ allegation by the brother of slain Enugu East Labour Party senatorial candidate, Oyibo Chukwu, that it masterminded his killing. Sunday PUNCH reported that the group is the political movement floated by a former governor of Enugu State and candidate of the state Peoples Democratic Party, Chimaroke Nnamani. The deceased’s brother, Arthur had alleged that his late brother before his death confided in some persons that he was being trailed by members of the Ebeano political group. But in a statement on Saturday, the group’s zonal leader, Emmanuel Okwor, said the organisation consists of credible, responsible men and women of proven integrity across Nigeria. Okwor said, “We are pained by the senseless killings; we expect people to be rational. It’s unfair to accuse innocent persons of something they do not know anything about.’’ Okwor stated that the Ebeano Political Family had before now been consistent in the condemnation of violent crimes and the sit-at-home order by the Indigenous People of Biafra, which negatively affected residents’ commerce and social life. He frowned at the accusation, adding that it was misdirected because the assassins had attacked and killed PDP and All Progressives Congress’ members too. Okwor said, “It is unfair and uncharitable to accuse the Ebeano family of this heinous crime. As much as we do not want to join issues with the family, we strongly take exception to this accusation. “We have challenged the security operatives not to leave any stone unturned in the quest to unravel the circumstances of Chukwu’s murder to bring the perpetrators to justice. We are concerned about the deteriorating security situation and call on all citizens to cooperate with security agencies to get to the root of the matter. We do not expect reckless and unfounded accusations at this point.”
