The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited has completed the rehabilitation of the pipeline at the Satellites depots area, The PUNCH has learnt. The repairs were carried out through the NNPCL subsidiary, NNPCL Pipeline and Marketing. Chairman, of Satellite Depots, Akin Akinrinade, told Sunday PUNCH that the pipeline had been repaired and is currently being used to transport products to its members. “Satellite depots started loading at about 12:30 pm on Tuesday after 15 months of inactivity. “We now load through the pipeline because the integrity has been restored,” he noted, adding that loading products through the pipelines would not be a one-off arrangement. Akinrinade confirmed to Sunday PUNCH that his members had started receiving products since last week Friday. The depot had been moribund due to pipeline vandalism which made NNPCL halt supplies of products to the depot. “Although they have instructed depots to sell at N172 per litre, we have not started selling to marketers. We have started receiving products since Friday. We received it on Saturday, and some will also come in today (Sunday). “Since products are now being received, prices will now come down, and I can assure you that the remaining queue will disappear this week,” he assured.
