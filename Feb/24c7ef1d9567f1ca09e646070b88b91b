The member representing the Babura/Garki federal constituency in Jigawa State, Musa Fagengawo, has resigned his membership from the ruling All Progressive Congress. Also, Bala Kila, a Special Adviser to the Governor of Jigawa State on Afforestation, Mohammed Badaru, dumped the ruling APC for the Peoples Democratic Party. Fagengawo made the disclosure in a letter he signed and sent to the APC chairman of the Kore ward in the Garki local government area of the state, according to a Tribune report. He said his decision followed the series of conflicts happening at all stages of the APC. He wrote, “I write to notify that I resigned my membership of the All Progressive Congress (APC) from 21st of February 2023. This (is) due to the series of conflicts happening at all stages of party.” He added that, “Meanwhile, I thank the party for giving me opportunity for contest on its platform.” The serving member of the House of Representatives also announced his defection to opposition PDP. Briefing newsmen shortly after he was received by the PDP executives at the residence of the party’s governorship candidate in Dutse, the state capital, the lawmaker said his decision followed a wider consultation with his constituents. “I am here because I want to help a friend, we attended the same university, I am here to help the party win the election,” he added. Meanwhile, the special adviser in a letter addressed to the state governor through the Secretary to the State Government resigned his appointment from the position of special adviser.
