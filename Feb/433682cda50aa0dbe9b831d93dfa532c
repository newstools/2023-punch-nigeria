The Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu; the Chairman of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, Abike Dabiri-Erewa; and other dignitaries have been scheduled to grace the maiden edition of the national migration summit of the Journalists International Forum For Migration. This was disclosed by the President of JIFORM, Dr Ajibola Abayomi, in a statement on Sunday, adding that the governor has been invited to unveil the summit while Dabiri-Erewa would deliver a keynote address at the event to be held in Ikeja, Lagos. He said, “The summit scheduled for February 9 serves as an annual retreat to accommodate capacity building for journalists covering migration and other stakeholders as a platform to contribute to policies and issues on migration matters. “The greatness of nations is measured by how they react and take decisions when confronted with challenges. As a concerned media body, we are ready to join hands with the government and other organisations to stem the tide of irregular migration and human trafficking. “The main lecture of the summit themed, ‘The missing links and the remedy,’ would be delivered by Professor Lai Oso from the University of Lagos under the chairmanship of the United Kingdom-based Continental Chairman of the Nigerians In Diaspora, Dr Bashir Obasekola.”
