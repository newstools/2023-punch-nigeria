The Christian Association of Nigeria, Kaduna State Chapter, has demanded the probe of banks hoarding the new naira notes. This was as the association hailed the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for insisting that the 2023 elections must be free and devoid of vote-buying. The Christian group through its Chairman, Rev. John Hayab, in a statement in Kaduna on Sunday, also commended Buhari for the 10 days extension given for the swap of the old naira notes. However, CAN called on the Central Bank of Nigeria to do everything possible within its power to ensure that the new notes circulate to end the stress being faced by the Nigerian masses in accessing the new notes. The association said, “Notwithstanding CAN believes that despite the temporary pains Nigerians face, the citizenry is prepared to support the President on the matter of the deadline, especially if it would assist to ease the tension in the country. “Therefore, managers of banks who are found to hoard the new naira notes to create artificial scarcity, but are behind the public arena helping money-bag politicians to get the new notes, set the public up against the CBN’s new policy; such banks and bankers should be investigated, and if found culpable be made to face the wrath of the law. “Nigerian citizens are yearning for the best and should not be made to suffer more hardships. Accordingly, CAN will continue to sensitise and mobilise our faithful to support any programme which its results could bring about good service delivery for a better nation.”
