The Aare Onakakanfo of Yoruba land, Gani Adams, has described the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, as a man of integrity but said he has not endorsed him yet. The duo met in Lagos on Monday and Adams said Obi’s visit was an opportunity for the LP candidate to present the blueprint of his party to him. This is as Adams noted that the Oodua Peoples Congress would not be used to disrupt Lagos and Yoruba land during the elections. Adams said, “Your visit is not an endorsement but it is an opportunity for you to present the blueprint of your party to us as an organisation. With the point you have highlighted so far, it is my hope that you are a man of integrity. My prayer is that God will grant your heart’s desires. “I appreciate your gesture and respect for the revered stool of the Aare Onakakanfo of Yoruba land. It is a show of your passion and dedication. “Your (Obi) respect for the stool of the Aareonakakanfo of Yoruba land is a reflection of your understanding of Nigeria’s problems.” Adams also said for now the OPC is neutral as regards who to support for the seat of the president, adding that consultations with stakeholders would commence soon. “As the Aareonakakanfo of Yoruba land, leader of the OPC and global convener of the OPU, we are neutral for now. However, we will discuss the issue at the various meetings of our stakeholders both in Nigeria and in the diaspora. “Anybody that wants to be the Nigerian president should restructure the country into federating units where each region will develop at their pace. “With all your beautiful ideas, if Nigeria is not restructured to regionalism, it will be very difficult to achieve.” Adams also said he has always had a good relationship with the Igbos.
