The Association of Corporate Affairs Managers of Banks, the umbrella body of Corporate and Marketing Communications Professionals working in Nigeria’s ban king sector, has debunked the message purporting that the Central Bank of Nigeria is shutting down banking services for five days for Saturday’s presidential polls. Specifically, the reports claimed that banks would shut down between February 23rd  and 27th. In a statement issued by the ACAMB on Wednesday, and signed by President, ACAMB,  Rasheed Bolarinwa, the body described the report as fake news. The statement read in part, “There is no iota of truth in the viral message that is being circulated. Up until this moment, no Deposit Money Banks  or other institutions providing financial services have received any directive or communication from the CBN to close the doors of their physical banking halls or shut their digital platforms and online banking channels against their customers because of elections.” ACAMB assured customers that banks had put adequate measures in place to ensure depositors continue to access money in their accounts during this period. It added, “Customers who wish to carry out transfers or use electronic banking services will have unhindered access to these services before, during, and after the elections.”
