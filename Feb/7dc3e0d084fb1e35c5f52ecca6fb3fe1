English second-tier strugglers Queens Park Rangers have sacked manager Neil Critchley after only 12 games in charge, it was announced Sunday. Critchley was appointed on a three-and-a-half-year deal in December after Michael Beale left the west London club the previous month to take charge of Scottish giants Glasgow Rangers. Former Blackpool manager Critchley oversaw a victory in his first match as QPR boss — 1-0 at Preston — and it proved the only one of his tenure at Loftus Road. QPR are currently 17th in the Championship table, eight points above the relegation zone, and were also knocked out of the FA Cup by third-tier Fleetwood last month. QPR chief executive Lee Hoos said sacking Critchley was “disappointing” but that “after seeing the team slip from play-off contenders to one being drawn into a relegation battle, the board felt it had to act”.
