Operatives of the Nigeria Drug Law Enforcement Agency at the NAHCO export shed of the Muritala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos State, have arrested a pregnant woman, Mrs Sylvester Onome, after 800grams of skunk were allegedly discovered concealed in two small radio sets she was sending to Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The NDLEA spokesman, Femi Babafemi, in a statement on Sunday, confirmed the incident, adding that the suspect was arrested on Monday, January 30. “Another housewife, Mrs Okpara Chizoba, was arrested at her residence at 37, Obashola Street, Ijesha, Lagos, on Friday, January 27, following the seizure of 300g of skunk hidden in a bag of crayfish she was sending to Dubai, UAE, through a freight agent. “In the same vein, operatives at the SAHCO export shed of the airport on Thursday, January 26, intercepted a sack of new clothes going to Sierra Leone. “During a thorough search of the consignment, a parcel of white crystalline substance that tested positive to methamphetamine with a gross weight of 1kg, as well as 300g of skunk and 100g ecstasy were recovered. A freight agent, Mfonabasi Joseph, was already arrested in connection with the seizure,” Babafemi added. He stated that a 40-year-old secondary school teacher, Sani Isah, was also arrested by operatives in the Jekadefari area of Gombe State on Thursday, January 2, for dealing in a new psychoactive substance, Akuskura.
