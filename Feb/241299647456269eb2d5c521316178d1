Federico Chiesa and Paul Pogba will both miss Juventus’ Europa League play-off clash with Nantes after being left out of the squad on Wednesday. Italy forward Chiesa is out of Thursday’s second leg in France with a muscle problem after also missing Juve’s win at Spezia on Sunday. Pogba is still yet to play for Juve since returning from Manchester United after suffering a serious knee injury in July last year. Italian media reported that the France midfielder could be in the Juve squad for their local derby with Torino in Serie A on February 28. Poland forward Arkadiusz Milik is also out with a thigh injury suffered at the end of last month. The Europa League is Juve’s most realistic path to next year’s Champions League as they are 12 points from the Serie A top four following a points deduction for illicit transfer activity in January. Juve and Nantes are level at 1-1 following last week’s first leg in Turin. AFP
