A 95-year-old man, Aremu Ajayi, who voted at his polling unit in Abeokuta, Ogun State, tells SAHEED OLUGBON why Nigerians who are of voting age should always exercise their franchise What inspired you to come out to vote even as an elderly person? My name is Deji Aremu Ajayi. I am 94 years and eight months old. In as much as I am still alive, I will continue to vote; I will do what is expected of me and necessary as a citizen. What advice do you have for people who refused to vote? It is their choice; we should do what is expected of us. If we refuse to vote, we will suffer the consequences, and we are the government; if we fail to do what is expected of us at the right time, we would be hurting ourselves. Everybody should begin to think. Everyone who has a PVC is expected to vote. How many times have you voted? It’s countless, I can’t really say. I have been voting since 1960 when independence came. I started voting when we had the Northern Region, Western Region and Eastern Region.
