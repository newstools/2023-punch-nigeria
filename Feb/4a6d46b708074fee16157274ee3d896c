The Supreme Court on Friday affirmed Lawal Adamu Usman as the Senatorial candidate of the People’s Democratic Party PDP for Kaduna Central Senatorial District of Kaduna State. The apex court, in a unanimous decision by a five-member panel, dismissed the appeal filed by an aggrieved governorship aspirant of the party, Usman Ibrahim as unmeritorious. The Justice Inyang Okoro-led panel said it found no reason to set aside the earlier decision of the Court of Appeal that equally dismissed Ibrahim’s case. Justice Helen Ogunwumiju, who delivered the lead judgment of the apex court, held that the decision of the NWC of the party was correct and could not be faulted. Earlier, the Abuja division of the Court of Appeal had in a judgment delivered on December 19, 2022, reinstated Usman as the candidate of the PDP for the February 25 senatorial elections, voiding the verdict of the Federal High Court in Kaduna which had nullified the primary election the party conducted for Kaduna Central Senatorial District. Before this, the trial court had in its judgment, invalidated the outcome of the primary poll and ordered a rerun which was again won by Usman. Dissatisfied by the publication of Usman’s name by INEC, Ibrahim, who came second at the poll that was held on May 23, 2022, returned to court.
