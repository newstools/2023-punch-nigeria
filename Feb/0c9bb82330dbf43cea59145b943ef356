The Chairman of Access Bank and Honourable Consul to Czech Republic, Dr. Mrs Ajoritsedere Awosika, has been appointed matron and adviser to Eko Inspires Me Academy project, a not-for-profit initiative aimed at taking street urchins off the streets of Lagos. A statement said while speaking during a courtesy visit to Awosika at her Ikoyi Lagos office, the Founder of the NGO, Aralola Olamuyiwa, who is popularly known as ARA and a drummer, reiterated Awosika’s public service records, corporate boardroom achievements and her love for service to humanity as reasons for adopting her as matron to Eko Inspires Me Academy. She said, “The Eko Inspire Me Academy is an initiative established to cater for street boys and girls that are seen as a menace and threats to peaceful living in a smart city like Lagos. The NGO is established to seek, identify, and motivate the street boys and girls out of their assumed lifestyles with a view towards settling and getting them constructively engaged to become better citizens with a hope for better tomorrow.” In her response, Awosika thanked Olamuyiwa for the honour of appointing her to the board of advisers and as a matron. She noted ARA’s achievement in a competitive world of drumming and commended her for staying tall among men. She noted her uniqueness in creativity, passion for her assignment and tenacity of purpose. On Eko Inspires Me Academy, Awosika appreciated ARA for devoting time for the less privileged, nothing that the initiative was a major problem solver that could reduce the worries of Lagos State Government tremendously, while also praying that the project should go international alongside the United Nations Strategic Development goals. She prayed for ARA’s continued success in her endeavours.
