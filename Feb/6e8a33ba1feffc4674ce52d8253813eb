A real estate firm, Wealth Island Properties Africa, has urged its subscribers to adhere to the rules and regulations laid down by the government while constructing their buildings. The Chief Executive Officer of Wealth Island Properties Africa, Akintade Esan, said this in a statement availed to The PUNCH on Sunday. He said, “WIP Africa has a very cordial relationship with the government, and our goal is to open up this channel for our clients to take advantage of, such that they won’t fall short of the law whenever they choose to start their development. “However, we are aware that some people have equally deep connections through family or professional affiliation, which they can explore independently as well. “We would be glad to guide anyone willing to seek support through us.” Esan noted that his firm has been in the vanguard of supporting Lagos State’s infrastructural development agenda with numerous engineering approaches to land reclaims that had won his team accolades. He added, “Alignment with the government in following requisite processes that have been stipulated is very essential, particularly to having building projects sorted from start to finish, including abiding by accredited professionals at every stage of the development.” Speaking on the importance of reclaiming marginal land, the Chief Operating Officer of WIP Africa, Olayinka Ilori, called for efforts to make things easier for the government. He said, “Lagos land is under pressure, and every effort to reclaim marginal land will greatly help the government’s housing and infrastructural projects.”
