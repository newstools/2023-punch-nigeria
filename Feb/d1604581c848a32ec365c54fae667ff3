The Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, on Thursday, formally launched the state Community Safety Corps with the inauguration of the first batch of 603 trainees of the security outfit in Yenagoa. The inauguration was part of events lined up to commemorate the three-year anniversary of the Diri-led administration in the state. The governor urged the recruited personnel to operate within the rules of engagement and not operate as tax collectors, settlers of land disputes or domestic issues but rather work with statutory security agencies to rid the state of criminals. He said, “You are indeed the pride of Bayelsa State. You have undergone some set of training and are expected to know your rules and act within the rules of engagement. “You are not trained to become debt collectors neither are you trained to settle land disputes or counsellors in domestic conflicts or nuisance in the state or subtly encourage crime in your areas of jurisdiction.” The governor noted that the establishment of the corps was in line with his administration’s mantra of prosperity where Bayelsans and other residents would live and work without fear due to crime.
