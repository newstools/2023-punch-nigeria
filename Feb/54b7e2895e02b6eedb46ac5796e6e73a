The National Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party has distanced itself from fake reports purported to have emanated from the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Debo Ologunagba, claiming that the PDP had directed its legal team to withdraw certain cases in Rivers State. Some media platforms (not The PUNCH) had in January reported that the National Chairman of the party, Iyorchia Ayu, ordered the legal team of the party to discontinue representation of the cases instituted in Rivers State. In a statement issued in Abuja on Saturday, Ologunagba said “the PDP had declared that it does not have any record of individuals that were gifted forms for their loyalty to Governor Nyesom Wike; that an individual made “buck” purchase of forms on behalf of Governor Wike and that the PDP is ready to do a rejoinder on the issue. The statement added that the National Publicity Secretary did not at any time issue any report, press statement or any publication whatsoever on any issue relating to the purchase of forms or withdrawal of any case(s) in Rivers State as maliciously claimed in the said fake report. “The PDP therefore strongly condemns the said fake report which is clearly the handiwork of enemies of our Party and urges Nigerians, particularly our teeming members and supporters in Rivers State to disregard the said report. “The NWC uses this opportunity to alert the public of designs by enemies of the PDP to circulate fake reports and documents claiming such to have emanated from National Officers of our Party, apparently in a bid to cause disaffection within our Party and mislead the unsuspecting public. “The PDP national leadership has however commenced investigation into those behind this malicious publication and will take very firm legal and punitive actions against any individual found culpable in accordance with the law as well as the Constitution of the PDP” the statement further stated. Ologunagba stressed that the public should note that the PDP has official ways of circulating its information adding that such publications which did not emanate from the official channels should be ignored.
