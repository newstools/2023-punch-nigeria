The Ondo State Police Command has arrested a 20-year-old apprentice, Josiah Godwin, for allegedly hacking his master, Saviour Joseph, to death at Imafon community, in the Akure South Local Government Area of the state. PUNCH Metro gathered that the suspect, after killing the deceased, dumped his corpse in a well at a site where they were working. A source said trouble started when the deceased, an asbestos operator, smashed the phone of the suspect on the floor over a dispute and the suspect attacked the deceased in retaliation. Narrating the incident, the elder brother of the deceased, Mr Odey Ogbaji, said the body of the 27-year-old was found four days ago in a well at the site where he (deceased) and his apprentice (suspect) went to work. He said, “Last week Tuesday, my brother called me in the morning and we spoke. But on Wednesday, I tried his number but couldn’t get through. I thought he had a flat battery, until Saturday that I was called by another younger brother of mine briefing me on his efforts to reach him but not successful. “Afterwards, the deceased’s apprentice was contacted. When they got the boy, they asked him about the whereabouts of his master and he said his boss woke him up at night, collected his phone, smashed it on the floor and began to beat him and later asked him to go back and sleep. “He said the following day, he decided to leave the site. So, we asked him how he would wake up in the morning without seeing his boss and leave the site. He said he thought his master went to a toilet when he left. “When we checked the phone which he said was smashed, there was no scratch on it.” The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mrs Funmilayo Odunlami, confirmed the incident, adding that the suspect had been arrested. She said, “The boy was angry, killed his boss and threw his body inside a well. The matter has been transferred to the State Criminal Investigative Department and after investigation, he will be charged.”
