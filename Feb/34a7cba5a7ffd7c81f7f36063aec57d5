The Adamawa State Residential Electoral Commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Mr Hudu Yunusa, has slated 8:30pm for the commencement of the collation of election results for the presidential election that took place on Saturday. Yunusa, who arrived at the Adamawa State office of the commission located at No. 33, Galadima Aminu Way, Jimeta-Yola at 7:19 pm in the company of employees of the commission, blamed the late arrival of election results from the 21 Local Government Areas of the state for the delayed commencement of collation. He noted that so far only results from seven local government areas had been received, assuring that more would come before the commencement of collation. He said, “We have received results from seven local governments out of 21. So far, we have Lamurde, Girie, Shelleng, Guyuk Toungo, Ganye and Mayo-Belwa Local Government Areas. By 8:30pm, we would have gotten more results. “Please bear with us. It is better for news to be late than to be fake. This is my watchword. It is better that we have the news late than to fake it and throw it out to the public.” Yunusa also confirmed the conduct of fresh elections in a polling unit in Yola North on Sunday, saying, “Yes, on Saturday we had an incident. It happened in just one unit in the Yola North Local Government Area. What happened is that the Electoral Officer refused to use the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System. When the voters realised that the BVAS was not deployed, they got angry and said it was a ploy to deny them their right to vote. This resulted in a near problem but with the intervention of the commission, the challenge was addressed. The election was held today.” As of the time of filing this report, security officers made up largely of the police, National Drug Law Enforcement Agency and the Federal Road Safety Commission, had been deployed to the collation centre.
