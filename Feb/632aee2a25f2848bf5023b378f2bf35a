The Vice Chancellor, Osun State University, Osogbo, Prof. Clement Adebooye, has warned students of the institution that are of voting age against selling their votes and involvement in thuggery during the forthcoming polls. Adebooye spoke in Osogbo on Tuesday at the 16th matriculation ceremony of the university, where 6,750 new students were formally admitted as undergraduates. The VC, who also warned the new students against projecting the institution negatively on social media, charged them to always make use of available communication channels, whenever there were issues they wanted the management to work on. On what he expected of the university’s students during the forth-coming poll, Adebooye said, “our students should vote their conscience. They should not be involved in vote-buying because it is a crime. “Let’s make this country work. The way we can make this country work is to shun all acts that can bring down the tempo of the nation. “We have to make the nation work. Make Nigeria project work. Don’t engage in violence during the election. Don’t allow any politician to conscript you into thuggery group to terrorise other human beings during the election.” He further advised the new students to be serious with their studies and prepare well ahead of their examinations with an assurance that the university’s management would remain focused on their welfare. “I must assure you that the thrust of our student administration policy is to provide an environment that is completely conducive for effective learning. “We take our students as critical stakeholders, and we consistently ensure they have sweet memories and high level of satisfaction in their sojourn within our walls,” Adebooye concluded.
