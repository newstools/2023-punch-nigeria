Agents of the Peoples Democratic Party and the All Progressives Congress locked horns during voting at Polling Unit 019, Ita Aro Square, Ã€ga/Ijimu ward in Ikorodu, Lagos State. The clash began when an assistant presiding officer of the Independent National Electoral Commission assigned to the centre closed voting by 3.30 pm. Unsatisfied with the decision, the APC agent insisted that voting should continue. However, the agent of the PDP, who did not want voting to continue, vehemently refuses, hurling verbal attacks at his APC counterpart. As of the time of filing this report, both parties were still embroiled in a verbal duel.
