The operation by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to deter vote-trading and other financial misconduct ahead of (Saturday) today’s presidential and National Assembly elections may have begun paying dividends with the interception in Lagos of the sum of N32.4m suspected to be used for vote-buying in Lagos. In a statement on Friday, the spokesperson for the EFCC, Wilson Uwujaren, revealed that the recovery was made by operatives of the Lagos Zonal Command of the commission. He noted that the suspect involved had been taken into custody for further questioning. The PUNCH reports that the Chairman of the EFCC, Abdulrasheed Bawa has implored all personnel of the commission deployed for election monitoring duties to show courage and not give room for unscrupulous persons to undermine the integrity of the elections through financial inducement. Uwujaren added, “Tactical teams of operatives are currently on the ground in all the states of the federation and the FCT. “Telephone hotlines have already been circulated through social media for members of the public to share information regarding financial malpractices with agents of the commission. Details of the number are available on EFCC social media platforms.”
