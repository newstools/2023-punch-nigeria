The Minister of information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, on Monday lampooned foreign embassies which issued travel advisories, warning their citizens to avoid Abuja due to the risk of a terrorist attack. According to him, their advisories unsettled many residents and foreigners who fled the nation’s capital despite the assurances from the Federal Government. He spoke at the 25th edition of the PMB Administration Scorecard Series in Abuja. He said, ” Let me use this occasion to commend our security agencies for their sacrifices to keep us safe. Recall, Ladies, and Gentlemen, that in October 2022, the US and UK embassies in Nigeria issued travel advisories warning their citizens to avoid Abuja due to the risk of a terrorist attack. This advisories created much panic in the country. As a matter of fact, a number of Americans were reported to have fled Abuja in the wake of the warning. “Recall also that in our reaction to the advisories, we reassured Nigerians and non-Nigerians living in the country for their safety and noted that our security agencies are on top of the matter.” He commended the military and other security agencies for keeping the FCT safe despite the advisories. The minister, however, warned western countries to stop issuing frivolous travel advisories on Nigeria. “Almost three months after the frivolous advisories, residents of Abuja have been going about their business without any threat. “It is in this light that we want to, once again, commend our gallant troops, the police, the intelligence agencies, and all other security agencies for their commitment and sacrifice to keep our country safe. We also call on Nigerians to continue to support the security agencies as they carry out their onerous task while echoing Mr. President’s call on Western countries to stop issuing frivolous travel advisories on Nigeria, ” said Mohammed.
