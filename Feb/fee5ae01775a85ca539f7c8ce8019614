The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has urged Nigerians to vote for their candidates of choice in the February 25 and March 11 elections, assuring them that “Your vote shall count”. This was as he assured the electorate that adequate security has been provided to ensure a hitch-free exercise. Buhari revealed this on Thursday in a national broadcast from the State House, Abuja. The President said, “I urge every citizen, therefore, to go out to vote for their candidates of choice without fear, because security shall be provided and your vote shall count. “I however admonish you to eschew violence and avoid actions capable of disrupting the electoral processes.” While announcing the new April 10 deadline for the circulation of the old N200 notes, Buhari affirmed that the new Naira policy implemented by the Central Bank of Nigeria has curbed money politics. “I am aware that this new monetary policy has also contributed immensely to the minimization of the influence of money in politics. “This is a positive departure from the past and represents a bold legacy step by this administration, towards laying a strong foundation for free and fair elections,” he said.
