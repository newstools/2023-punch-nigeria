A former lawmaker, Shehu Sani, has advised Nigerians to focus on the upcoming election rather than protesting the naira and fuel scarcity in the country. The senator, who represented Kaduna Central senatorial district in the 8th National Assembly, made this known via his Twitter page on Wednesday. Sani tweeted, “The general public must avoid any form of protest in d name of cash or fuel scarcity at this 11th hour. The people in d south east must defy any call for sit at home. Any spark is intended to lead to conflagration. Anti democratic elements must be resisted. Let’s focus on d election. ”
