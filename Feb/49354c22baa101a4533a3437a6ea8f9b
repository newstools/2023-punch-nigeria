The Lagos State Real Estate Regulatory Authority has called on practising realtors to support its fight against quacks in the real estate industry. The Special Adviser to Lagos State Governor on Housing, Toke Benson-Awoyinka, while speaking at an event organised by the Association of Estate Agents in Nigeria and the International Association of Realtors, in Lagos, asked the realtors to collaborate with the state government to rid the real estate industry of quacks The authority further called on realtors to complement the state government’s efforts to improve the integrity of real estate development for the future of Lagos State, Nigeria, and potential investors/investees. Benson-Awoyinka, who was represented at the event by LASRERA’s Project Manager, Bolanle Asuquo, stated that the real estate market, being a huge sector, demands that players in the sector must abide by laws that guide the practitioners, especially agents, to carry out their duties in a very professional manner. She said, “Benson-Awoyinka noted that the fact that individuals/organisations are already registered with their relevant professional bodies should not be the reason why they would disregard the provisions of laws guiding real estate practice in the state.” The Special Adviser maintained that many people had encroached into the profession because of the belief that the real estate sector was the best market sector that promoted ease of doing business. She added, “In developed countries, becoming a realtor requires a license, but in Nigeria, anyone can become an agent at any time. This unfortunate situation had led to potential renters/buyers being swindled and deceived by unscrupulous individuals/organisations.’’
