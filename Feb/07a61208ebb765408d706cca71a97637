The Osun State Governor and the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the July 16, 2022 governorship polls in the state, Ademola Adeleke, has told the Court of Appeal that the decision of the Justice Tertsea Kume-led Election Petition Tribunal that annulled his victory at the poll was not the majority decision of the panel. His Notice of Appeal filed before theÂ  Court of Appeal, Akure Division, against January 27 decision of the panel that nullified his victory, obtained in Osogbo on Thursday was signed by his lead counsel, Dr Onyeachi Ikpeazu (SAN), on behalf of 26 other lawyers. The PDP candidate listed 31 grounds to fault the decision of the tribunal. Adeleke contended that the tribunal decided the matter without considering the totality of his case, adding that the panel also expressed bias against him by making fun of his love for dancing. He also said reports of entries on BVAS machines used for accreditation during the poll was superior and unique, adding that the panel should not have granted the prayers sought by the petitioners.
