The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Monday afternoon met with the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, at the State House, Abuja. Emefiele arrived at the villa around 1:00pm, shortly after the President returned from the Police Force Headquarters, where he had unveiled some patrol vehicles to be deployed for the upcoming elections earlier today. In total, the CBN Chief has encountered the President at least six times both privately and in the company of other government officials. The PUNCH reports that Emefiele attended last Fridayâ€™s Council of State meeting where he assured the Council that the new naira notes scarcity would not hinder the free flow of logistics during the electoral exercise. Although Emefiele did not speak with journalists after the meeting, it is believed that both leaders discussed the cash crunch and the attendant crisis.
