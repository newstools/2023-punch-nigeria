 The Independent National Electoral Commission has said that a total of 1.6 million voters will be participating in Saturday’s elections. The Resident Electoral Commissioner, Dr Gabriel Longpet disclosed this on Tuesday while briefing journalists on the commission’s preparedness. “We also recognise the fact that some BVAs may malfunction during the exercise. We have been given additional 250 BVAs machines to replace those that may develop faults along the line” He said. He also said that INEC had sent materials to all Local Government Areas. Longpet noted that the commission had recorded series of reports where some political parties were denied from holding their rallies. He added that INEC is fully committed to a transparent, free and fair election.
