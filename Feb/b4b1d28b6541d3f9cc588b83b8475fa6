The Labour Party in Kano State has described its governorship candidate, Bashir Bashir, who defected to the All Progressives Congress as an impostor who had never been a genuine member of the party. The Kano State Chairman of the Labour Party, Mohammed Abdullahi, made the remark on Monday while briefing newsmen on the recent development in the party. “We are aware of some deceptive, pretentious, fake and misleading actions of some forces who are not genuine party members and who are bent on shattering the dream of victory for labour party at the polls. “For example, we are privy to a plot by someone who falsely claimed that the Labour Party is losing grip. “The said pretender is spiritedly trying to woo other genuine candidates of our party to go with him. His dream is a dead dream.We recognise and concede that it’s the fundamental right of anybody to choose and belong to a political party of his or her choice. “However, we are quick to reckon that the impostor in question was not a member of Labour Party. So, he cannot leave the house (Labour party) in which he did not inhabit, “ Abdullahi said. He maintained that Bashir was not also recognised by the Independent National Electoral Commission as the authentic governorship candidate of the LP in Kano State. So, he came empty and went empty. “It is my name that is in the INEC list of governorship candidates of our party,” he added. He said the party would not continue to allow such unpatriotic party members or anybody to trade in the name of the party, “which we have laboured day and night to nurture and consolidate in Kano State” He restated the commitment of the “genuine party members” to fully support the Obi/Datti movement 2023  hundred per cent in Kano, adding that anybody who wanted to leave could do so as it was their democratic right.
