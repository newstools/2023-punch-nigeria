The new coach was recently the coach of Wikki Tourists, a football club in Bauchi State in the Nigeria Premier League. His new task comes with expectations to help the Ilorin football team enhance their performance and move up on the NPFL log. His first game in charge of Kwara United will be the midweek fixture against Remo Stars of Ogun State.
