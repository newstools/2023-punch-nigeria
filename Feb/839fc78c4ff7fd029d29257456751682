The Supreme Court on Friday affirmed Kefas Agbu as the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in Taraba State for the forthcoming governorship election. The affirmation upholds the decision of the Appeal Court sitting in Yola, Adamawa State, which dismissed two different suits filed by Hilkiah Buba-Joda and Jerome Nyameh. The two contenders challenged the eligibility of Agbu to contest the governorship primary election but their appeals were dismissed by the apex court. Delivering judgment, Justice Emmanuel Agim stated that the appellants acted in breach of sections 84 and 87(9) of the Electoral Act by failing to make use of the primary election dispute mechanism as contained in the partyâ€™s guidelines. Consequently, both appeals were considered premature and lacking in merit as the internal party redress options were not explored before heading to court.
