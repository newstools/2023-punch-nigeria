The Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission has said that it will complete the review of the remuneration for political, judicial and public office holders before the end of the current regime. This was according to a statement on Tuesday by the Commission’s PRO, Nwachukwu Christian. In the statement, it was noted that the Chairman of the Commission, Mohammed Shehu, gave the assurance while hosting members of the Nigerian Bar Association recently. The statement read, “The Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission has assured the Nation that the current review of the Remuneration for the  Political, Judicial and Public office holders in the country will be concluded before the end of the present administration, assuring that it will be fair in carrying out this constitutional mandate.” It was also noted that RMAFC had done public hearings on the review exercise in the six geopolitical zones of the country. However, the commission’s chairman lamented the lack of adequate funding for it to perform its mandate. “Mohammed however regretted poor funding of the Commission considering its strategic constitutional mandate to the socio-economic development of the Nation as a whole, promising to expedite action to conclude the review,” the statement read. It was also noted that the last review was done in 2008, and the process of the current review exercise would determine whether the pay for public office holders would increase or decrease.
