 The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, on Monday praised the Department of State Services for inviting former Minister of Aviation, Fani-Kayode, over a coup allegation. Fani-Kayode, the spokesperson for the All Progressives Congress Presidential Campaign Council, is expected to back his comment about Atiku and the military. The PUNCH reports the DSS invited Fani-Kayode, over allegations of a coup plot ahead of the February election. Fani-Kayode, a former minister under the Olusegun Obasanjo administration, confirmed the invitation in a statement on Monday. A statement by Atiku’s Special Assistant on Public Communications, Phrank Shaibu called on the DSS to carry out a proper investigation on the issue. He said Fani-Kayode must reveal the identity of the military personnel allegedly planning to overthrow the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd). “Fani-Kayode must also be made to reveal the identities of the so-called army generals who are plotting to overthrow the government of President Muhammadu Buhari. “Fani-Kayode and others in Tinubu’s camp have continued to prod the military by making allegations of coups and an interim government,” he said. He said the DSS also needed to question Fani-Kayode to give details of his relationship with the Indigenous People of Biafra, and other separatist organisations terrorising the nation’s peace and unity. “The DSS must thus leave no stone unturned in this investigation. It is obvious that Fani-Kayode is the one plotting the collapse of the Fourth Republic,” the statement read.
