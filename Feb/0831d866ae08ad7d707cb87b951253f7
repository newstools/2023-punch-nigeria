 Barely few days after the disbandment of Ebubeagu security outfit by the Federal High Court sitting in Abakaliki, the Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi, on Sunday, stated that four persons have so far lost their lives. The governor stated this while briefing journalists after a meeting with security chiefs at the Muhammadu Buhari lounge of the Ebonyi International Airport, located in Ezza South Local Government Area of the state. Umahi, who noted that desperation on the part of politicians was the reason behind some of the attacks and violence recorded in the state, called on security operatives, including men of the vigilance groups not to infringe on the rights of any resident of the state. He stated that the establishment of two vigilance groups will further aid the policing of the state, especially during this period of elections. He said, “I had a marathon meeting with security chiefs. There’s no way a governor will accept violence in a state. Desperation is the problem. I am not into a struggle with anybody. “Desperation is what is leading to the attacks and counter attacks in the State. Some vigilante members are in custody. Four people have been killed after the ban on Ebubeagu.
He noted that no pensioner is owed in the state and N3 billion has been paid for gratuity. Umahi further said, “We are talking to our people. Can they kill everybody, No. The people must rise for the election to be held. If there’s no vigilante in this town, you will be afraid to come out. Two new vigilantes have been established. “There’s no Ebubeagu in Ebonyi. Even if we appeal, I will not reconstitute them. If an Igbo man becomes president, he cannot develop Ebonyi State. We have served enough and it is time for others to serve us.”
