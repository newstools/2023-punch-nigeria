The Lagos State Government has ordered the temporary closure of Chrisland School, Opebi-Ikeja, following the death of a 12-year-old student of the school, Whitney Adeniran. The directive was contained in a statement on the Instagram page of the Lagos State Government on Sunday night. “A release signed by the State Commissioner for Education, Mrs. Folasade Adefisayo said the closure was ordered pending the outcome of a full investigation into the unfortunate incident. “We also note the impact of this unfortunate event on family, friends and acquaintance of Whitney and call for calm as we assure that no effort will be spared in investigating the incident,” the terse statement read. The PUNCH reports that Whitney allegedly died during the school inter-house sports events in Lagos. Earlier on Sunday, the deceased father claimed his daughter died of electrocution. Dr. Michael Adeniran made the claim in an interview with the BBC Pidgin on Sunday. Meanwhile, the school management in a statement on Sunday said the deceased slumped in “public view and not under any hidden circumstances,” adding that she was rushed to the nearest medical facility for first aid. “Our immediate response was to take advantage of proximity to first aid, by identifying the nearest medical facility to take her to, where the doctor on duty, administered oxygen and every aid possible on her,” the school added. Whitney’s parents had on Saturday raised the alarm over the death of their daughter during the school’s inter-house sports event at Agege Stadium.
