Stakeholders have called on the Federal Government of Nigeria to implement a ban on single-use plastic. The stakeholder who spoke at the Global Alliance for Incineration Alternatives Nigeria Members workshop on Civil Society Organisations Engagement with National and International Plastic Policy Processes in Lagos recently stated that the ban should take effect in 2024 instead of the 2028 date contained in the proposed National Policy on Plastic Waste Management. They suggested that the ban should start with styrofoam, microbeads, carrier bags, plastic spoons, straws, and disposable cups, as they had no economic value (recycling) potential. A statement issued by Global Alliance for Incineration Alternatives Nigeria noted the participants urged the government to urgently raise a National Plastic Treaty Steering Committee that would act to provide guidance and oversee the process. The group asked the government to avoid the adoption of waste-to-energy technologies such as municipal waste Incinerators and chemical recycling facilities, which they describe as ‘false solutions’. They noted that the unsustainable consumption of resources contributes to climate change, releases a cocktail of noxious substances that pose hazards to public health, and diverts funds from cheaper, sustainable zero-waste solutions. Also, the participants called on all national and state plastic policies to incorporate zero-waste principles, taking into account an entire lifecycle approach to plastic management and non-recyclable materials. They said, “While underlining the need for a nationwide campaign and the capacity development of policymakers on the toxicity of plastic within the plastic value chain in Nigeria.” They urged the government to declare a state of emergency on plastic production and its chemical constituent transparency. They also requested that all efforts by the public, private and civil societies be geared towards a zero-waste economy.
