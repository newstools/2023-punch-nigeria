Soldiers in Gombe State recovered two ballot boxes from thugs who snatched them from the Government Science Secondary School in the Jekadafari area of the state. The school was also the polling unit of the state’s Governor Muhammadu Yahaya. Yahaya was the North-East Coordinator of the Tinubu/Shettima Presidential Campaign Council. The thugs appeared with guns, cutlasses and other dangerous weapons when the counting for the House of Representatives election was underway, aiming to snatch ballot boxes, papers and other relevant materials. Out of the four boxes snatched, security personnel retrieved two. The incident happened around 7.20pm. An eyewitness, Abdulkadir Babangida, stated that the hoodlums arrived at the venue suddenly. He added, “They made away with four boxes, but the security operatives retrieved two from them. It took the intervention of the military to retrieve just two boxes from the four carried by the hoodlums.”
