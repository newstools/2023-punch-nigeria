The Lagos State Rapid Response Squad has arrived the Ibafo area of Ogun State to restore calm and clean up the debris made by protesters. The RRS team led by CSP Yinka Egbeyemi were sighted on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway clearing the debris of tyres burnt by the protesters. This was contained in the update shared in the official handle of the Rapid Response Squad, @rrslagos767. It read, “Our officials led by our commander, CSP Yinka Egbeyemi are presently in Ibafo on intelligence that hoodlums blocked the Lagos–Ibadan Expressway which created extended traffic to Otedola bridge.
“Our officers are claring debris of burnt tires left by the hoodlums. The area is calm.” The PUNCH had reported that the protests over the scarcity of new naira notes and fuel had spread to Ogun communities. The protesters had barricaded the Mowe end of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway turning motorists and travellers back. They also resisted police intervention and threatened to set the police station in the area ablaze.
