A group, Stand-Up Speak-Out Initiative, has charged youths and students to fulfil their civic responsibility by voting for credible candidates in the February 25 and March 11 elections. SUSO President, Dr Doyle Edeni, gave the charge on Friday at the University of Benin while delivering a lecture with the theme, ‘Students must vote campaign’, said a new Nigeria was possible. He said, “We are not rooting for any particular party or candidate but we are rooting for a good Nigeria, good governance and youthful leadership that will usher in the right leadership. “We want you to take the message to your campuses, communities, look for candidates that have character, vote them into offices and hold them accountable. Nigeria would be good if we continue to hold leaders accountable for their action.” He also urged citizens to ensure that they exercise their civic rights through their votes.
