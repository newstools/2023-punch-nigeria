The Federal Government has concluded plans to carry out aeromagnetic surveys in Edo, Ogun, Oyo, and parts of Kogi and Kwara states to improve the availability of geological information and data that would enhance the diversification of the economy through mineral sector development. The job, which will be undertaken by a consultant, Excalibur will involve the use of specialised aircraft flying at very low altitudes to capture magnetic anomalies. In Edo State, areas where data will be captured include Fugar in the Etsako West LGA, Etsako Central, Etsako East, Igueben, Ikpoba-Okha and Oredo LGAs. To mitigate the impact of palpable fears and tension, the Mineral Sector Support for Economic Diversification Project (MinDiver) has deployed a team to sensitise affected communities within the affected states. Speaking on the additional blocks of the Geophysical Mapping Survey in Edo State, Mr Ishaku Kigbu, the Media and Communication Officer of the Mineral Sector Support for Economic Diversification Project (MinDiver), a World Bank Assisted Project under the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, said the team is in Edo State for renewed sensitisation after the initial one carried out prior to the commencement of the activity. He said the Airborne Geophysical Mapping Survey started in June 2021, where a robust sensitisation and enlightenment campaign was employed in the 19 States that were to be covered. He said the programme which experienced overlaps due to weather conditions and logistical reasons had been progressing well since it started. He said, â€œThe current sensitisation exercise being embarked upon was to cover additional areas carved out to further re-sensitise the people of Edo not to panic upon sighting the aircraft. The reassurance is necessary due to the current security situation in the country.
