The Ondo State High Court sitting in Akure, the state capital, on Tuesday sentenced two persons, Ayuba Idris and Tasur Abubakar, to death by hanging for killing a couple. The convicts were arrested by the state police command in 2019 for killing one Kwaku Kwakye and his wife, Tope Kwakye, at their residence at Ojomo Akintan Estate along Ilesa/Owo Expressway, Akure. The police said the convicts were security guards in the employ of the deceased before killing her and fleeing. They were, however, arrested shortly after. The duo were charged to court on five counts of conspiracy, armed robbery and murder and the matter has been on since 2019. Delivering the judgement, Justice Williams Olamide said the prosecution had not successfully proved that the convicts were guilty of count one and two and discharged and acquitted them. But the court sentenced them to seven years imprisonment on count three which borders on conspiracy contained in count. The court also found the convicts guilty of count four and five and sentenced them to death by hanging .
