Tragedy struck in the ancient city of Kano on Thursday when four supporters of the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party, Rabiu Kwankwaso, were hacked to death by yet-to-be-identified thugs on the ever-busy Kano-Zaria road. According to an eyewitness account, the supporters were en route Kwana Dangora, which is about 110 kilometres away from Kano South to receive their presidential candidate when they ran into an ambush. Four persons lost their lives, while six vehicles were burnt in the clash that ensued as the security agents arrested 63 thugs who were armed with dangerous weapons. Confirming the bloodbath, the Public Relations Officer of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps in Kano State, DSC Ibrahim Abdullahi, said: “We have arrested about 63 suspected thugs who were disrupting public peace, wielding dangerous weapons, burning vehicles and snatching handsets from passers-by.” A press statement issued by the Corps in Kano added that the arrested thugs “will be investigated and arraigned in court for prosecution.” Earlier before the eruption of the chaos, the Kano Police Command had summoned and advised the leadership of the political parties in the state to suspend all political rallies on Thursday so as to avoid the eruption of violent clashes, but all their entreaties fell on deaf ears.
