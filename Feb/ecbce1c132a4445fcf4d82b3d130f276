 Frank Leboeuf has said that Chelsea’s current manager, Graham Potter needs to be replaced with former Real Madrid head coach, Zinedine Zidane. The Chelsea legend said this would be a good move for the club presently under the leadership of Todd Boehly. “I don’t know, but it would be a very good idea, I would be very pleased. “I never asked him if he wanted to come to England. I asked him if he didn’t speak English, but he responded in English. So, you know, he speaks English a little bit. “Yeah, he could be in charge of Chelsea, and I would be very, very happy about it,” he told ESPN. Zidane, who has been out of managerial duties since 2021, recently revealed his desire to return to management this year. It will be recalled that Chelsea lost to Southampton in their last Premier League tie on Saturday. The team has only been able to win two of their last 15 games.
