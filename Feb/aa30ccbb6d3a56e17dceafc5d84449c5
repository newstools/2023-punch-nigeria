A former President of the Senate, Pius Anyim, said he was at no time part of the G5 governors. He also affirmed his membership of the Peoples Democratic Party. The former lawmaker disclosed this late Friday in a statement he signed and made available to journalists in Abuja. The G5 governors, tagged the Integrity Group, include the Benue State Governor, Samuel Orton; Ikeazu Ikpeazu of Abia State; Ifeanyi Ugwanyi of Enugu State; Seyi Makinde of Oyo State and their arrowhead, Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike. The Integrity Group is known for its calls for the resignation of the National Chairman of the PDP over claims of lopsidedness in the party’s hierarchy. The former presidential hopeful was reacting to a newspaper report (not PUNCH) captioned ‘How G5 governors, other PDP leaders stand on presidential choice’, published on Friday. In his reaction, Anyim said, “My attention has been drawn to a front page story of a newspaper of 17/02/2023 with the above caption. I want to state upfront that at no time was I part of the G5 governors and or leaders [of the PDP]. “I am sufficiently knowledgeable of the events leading to and after the PDP presidential primaries and have my own convictions why I should not, in any way, be part of the G5 governors and leaders. “I want to state very clearly that after the presidential primaries, I chose to remain in the PDP as a leader and responsible citizen of Nigeria who should indeed place Nigeria over and above my personal interest. I must confess that this decision was reinforced by my experience from working with President Goodluck Jonathan.” He further remarked that, “It may be necessary to state that after the PDP presidential primaries, I have remained a faithful member of my party, the PDP, and have no intention whatsoever to leave my party, more so, as one of my campaign credits during the primaries was that I have remained in the party since 1999 even when many others had moved and back to the PDP many times.”
