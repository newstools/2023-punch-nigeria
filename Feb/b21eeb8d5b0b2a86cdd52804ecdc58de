The Bimodal Voter Accreditation System machine’s poor network marred voting process in some parts of Rivers State. A heavy rainfall which also began in the afternoon around Polling Unit 7, Ward 9, Rumuepirikom, Port Harcourt, in the state, sent some voters home. While some voted successfully, some voters were seen returning home as they said they were going home because of the poor network of the BVAS machine. A woman, who was seen returning home, said, “They said the network is bad,” when asked why she was leaving. The PUNCH earlier reported that the governor of the state, Nyesom Wike, could not vote when he came in the morning. The PUNCH also reported that the voters lamented earlier in the day after waiting since 8am at the polling unit but couldn’t get accredited. Accreditation began late at the polling unit as election materials and officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission were not also seen around 10am. Accreditation later resumed around 12pm, after which Wike also later voted. A voter, who earlier spoke with The PUNCH on condition of anonymity, said the situation was disappointing. He said, “We are disappointed. We have done our part, we got our Permanent Voter Cards to perform our civic duties, but we are in this situation. We are waiting and hoping they will fix the situation.” Another voter, who gave his name simply as Emeka, said, “Is this how we are going to be waiting?” When contacted earlier, the state Resident Electoral Commissioner, Dr Johnson Sinikem, assured the electorate that there would be no problem as technical officers were sent to the unit. “Yes, we are aware of the situation. No problem, we have sent our technical officers there,” he said. At the polling unit, voting was still ongoing as Wike after voting, called for an extension.
