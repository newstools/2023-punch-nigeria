The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, has made a wake-up call to Nigerians to help save the country from suffering. Obi made the call on Tuesday in Abuja at the launch of the book; Peter Obi: Many Voices, One Perspective, which explored his life and ideals. The former Anambra governor further warned that the forthcoming presidential poll was “an existential election,” that Nigeria cannot afford to take with levity. Obi warned that if the nation got its leadership choice wrong at the poll, the aftermath would be unpredictable. Obi at the event also canvassed the citizens to give him their votes to enable him to offer the good leadership they desired. He said, “We urge all of you to support us, especially in these final days, to reach the end of this race. Nigeria has suffered enough. This is a great country that can be turned around. We can’t succeed without your intervention.” Obi had on Monday, promised to reduce the cost of governance if elected in the upcoming presidential election. He disclosed this via his official Twitter handle on Monday as part of his address to the Nigerian Economic Summit Group. He tweeted, “We will work with the CBN to reduce the ‘ways and means’ to what is allowable under the law and for a more transparent and liberalized foreign exchange market.”
