The founder of Living Faith Church also known as Winners’ Chapel, Bishop David Oyedepo, has urged worshippers to vote wisely in the Saturday presidential election. The renowned bishop said he is for the peace and stability of Nigeria. Speaking during a sermon on Sunday at the Winners Chapel, the cleric also said Nigeria is not an entity or property but a people who are not for sale. Oyedepo said, “I am for the peace and stability of Nigeria, Nigeria is not for sale. We are not an entity or property, we’re a people and we are not for sale. Addressing the things to look out for in a candidate, he said, “You do not need to be a billionaire to be a president, you need capacity, you need character and we have them in every part of the country, everyone is free to join a party, but if you do not join the wellbeing of this nation, you are in problem. It will take an emergency intervention to revive this nation in gross distress. This week is decisive, so vote wisely. Vote for a leader with capacity and character.”
