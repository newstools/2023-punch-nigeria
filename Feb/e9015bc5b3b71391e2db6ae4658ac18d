Retired Supreme Court Justice Mary  Odili has been listed as one of the witnesses that will testify in the trial of the National Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, Edozie Njoku, for allegedly forging an apex court judgment. Justice Odili, who delivered the lead judgment on the prolonged APGA crisis on October 14, 2021, was added as a witness in an amended charge dated January 6, 2023. Njoku and the party’s National Youth Leader, Chuks Nwoga, are to appear at the Federal Capital Territory Court 40, Bwari on Tuesday (today), where they were earlier arraigned on January 4. This was according to a statement made available to The PUNCH on Monday by APGA Administrative Secretary, Chinedum Okoro. It would be recalled that shortly after the Supreme Court delivered judgment on the appeal filed by Jude Okeke challenging the decision of the Court of Appeal, Kano, which set aside the Jigawa State High Court’s decision that recognised him (Okeke) as acting national chairman, Njoku pointed out the error in the apex court judgment of October 14, 2021.
