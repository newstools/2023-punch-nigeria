The National Broadcasting Commission on Wednesday warned broadcasters covering the forthcoming general elections to abide by the provisions of the Nigeria Broadcasting Code, and other relevant regulations guiding the broadcast of elections in Nigeria. The NBC Director-General, Balarabe Ilelah, in a statement, urged all broadcasters to desist from using or allowing their facilities to be used by politicians and their supporters for the broadcast of contents that may lead to the breakdown of law and order. The statement read, “The commission has observed, with deep concerns, how ethics and ethos have been thrown to the winds by politicians using broadcast media platforms. This is against the provisions of the Nigeria Broadcasting Code, which provides that in using materials for news and current affairs programmes, the broadcaster shall avoid hate speech, inflammatory, derogatory, and divisive remarks or allusions. “The commission notes that some stations now glamorise these situations on their platforms. The National Broadcasting Commission reiterates that such stations shall pay for their professional misdemeanour.”
