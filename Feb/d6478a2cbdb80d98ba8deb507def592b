The Lagos State Police Command has summoned five police officers alleged to have extorted N155,000 from a student. The command spokesman, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, who disclosed this on Wednesday on his verified Twitter handle, said that all the officers were summoned to the state headquarters in Ikeja. He said those summoned included an Assistant Supretendant of Police and four Inspectors, adding that further updates will be provided on the case. It would be recalled that a polytechnic student, Sanni Faruk, had alleged that five police officers attached to Meiran Division extorted N155,000 from him on Sunday. He alleged that the officers forced him out of a bus at Abule-Egba, while on his way to school, handcuffed and took him to Meiran police station. He claimed that while at the station, he was forced to transfer the money in his bank account to an OPay account before he was released. He said that the N155,000 taken from him was for the payment of his accommodation in school. The case was reported to the state police command and the culprits were summoned to respond to the allegations. NAN
