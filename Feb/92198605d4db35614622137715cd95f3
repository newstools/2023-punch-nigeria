MEta, the parent company of social media platforms, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has said it will continue to invest in its platforms to encourage growth. In a statement by the tech company on Monday, it announced the exit of its Chief Business Officer, Marne Levine. Meta said, “We are proud that we have more people than ever using our platforms, and our investments in our business products continue to position Meta’s family of apps as the best place for businesses to build a community, engage with their customers, and find new ones. “Looking ahead, we’ll continue to invest in these products to help the businesses large and small that use our platforms grow because when they grow, we grow.” It was revealed that Levine announced her exit after 13 years at the company where she held multiple leadership roles. Speaking on Levine’s exit, Meta Chief Operating Officer, Olivan, said, “From running global policy, to growing our Instagram business as the first COO, to leading our ads and business partnerships teams, Marne has been an incredible leader at Meta over the last 13 years. I’m grateful for our partnership, her commitment to Meta, and the energy she brought to the company every day.” Following Levine’s exit, the company said Nicola Mendelsohn and Justin Osofsky were taking on expanded roles as “our most senior sales and partnership leaders, representing the company with its advertisers and partners and reporting to Chief Operating Officer Javier Olivan.” Marne will step down from the CBO role on February 21, 2023 and remain an employee until she departs in the summer, the statement said.
