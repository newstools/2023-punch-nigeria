The Obi-Datti Campaign Organisation has disclosed that the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, is not in talks with the Peoples Democratic Party candidate, Atiku Abubakar, over a possible alliance. The PUNCH reports that Atiku hinted at his readiness to work with Obi and the New Nigerian People Party’s candidate, Rabiu Kwankwaso, after meeting with the duo to support his ambition in the forthcoming election. Atiku made this known in a 15-minute interview with BBC Hausa service on Tuesday. Speaking with the interviewer in the Hausa language, Atiku said both Obi and Kwankwaso were not a threat to his chances of winning at the February 25 poll. “Although I see no threat in any of them, we are in talks, and the discussion might yield a positive result that will see one of them coming.” But reacting to the claim on Wednesday in an exclusive chat with The PUNCH, the Obi-Datti campaign organisation spokesperson, Yunusa Tanko, said those making the alliance claim are just trying to exploit Obi’s popularity. “As of yesterday, before we left Numan, there was nothing of such nature. We are busy with campaigns. We are not aware of anything like an alliance. “I think somebody is just trying to cash out on the Obi-Datti ticket. We are right now campaigning in Sokoto and we will be in Zamfara.” Efforts to get the spokesperson for the New Nigeria Peoples Party were futile as he did not pick up his calls as of the time of filing this report.
