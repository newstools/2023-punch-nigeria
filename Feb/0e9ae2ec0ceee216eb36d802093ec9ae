Facebook has said it will unveil an array of comment moderation tools and controls to make it easier for creators to manage conversations on the social network site. Creators will now be able to search comments by keywords, including emojis, commenter names and dates, on their posts and take bulk actions, such as liking or hiding, Tech Crunch said. These tools will be available through the comments manager section in Facebook’s Professional Dashboard. This is part of their way of marking the Safer Internet Day, the Meta-owned company said. Safer Internet Day is observed annually on February 7 to raise awareness of cyberbullying, social networking, digital identity and other emerging online issues and concerns. The leader of Facebook’s creator safety programs, Bobby Marshall, in a statement said, “Building tools that help keep creators and their communities safe is foundational to Facebook’s creator efforts, and we’ve continued to invest here. “We recently expanded Moderation Assist and introduced a Creator Support Hub last year. Today’s updates enable creators to far more easily search comments – by keyword, date, emoji and more – and to take bulk actions around them, such as liking or hiding them. Our goal with these tools is to give creators the time back to do what they do best – create content and build their community.” The social media giant also said it was introducing moderation statistics in their Moderation Assist’s Activity Log. This tool will proactively moderate new comments on creators’ posts using criteria they set in advance. With this new addition, creators will be able to see statistics about certain things, such as the number of comments that were hidden in the past 30 days. Also, creators can now view what criteria are met for hiding comments with the inline comment preview and criteria tag in the activity log of Moderation Assist.
