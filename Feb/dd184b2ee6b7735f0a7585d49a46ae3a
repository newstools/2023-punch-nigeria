The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Dr Abdullahi Adamu, on Monday held a crucial meeting with the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami and the three aggrieved governors who sued the Federal Government over naira redesign. The meeting held at the party’s secretariat. The governors are Nasir El Rufai (Kaduna), Yahaya Bello (Kogi) and Bello Matawalle (Zamfara). The closed-door meeting came on the heels of the call by the APC leadership that the Supreme Court ruling on the naira redesign policy be respected. The three governors filed a suit against the Federal Government seeking a restraining order on the full implementation of the naira redesign policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria. The meeting, which started at about 1.35pm, lasted over an hour before the attendees departed. Efforts to get them to address the media were unsuccessfull as they left without discussing or giving a hint on what was discussed at the meeting. “They won’t tell you anything. The national chairman has told them to ignore you people,” a source at the secretariat told our correspondent.
