Scores of youths from the All Progressives Congress on Monday defected to the Peoples Democratic Party in Delta State ahead of Saturday’s elections. While receiving the defectors, the vice presidential candidate of the PDP and Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State admonished them not to entertain fear over the outcome of the elections. He said, “We welcome you all to the PDP, the party is a big umbrella capable of covering everybody. “On Saturday’s presidential election, don’t worry, the PDP will win, there is no doubt about that. Politics is all about numbers, so when we come together, it will be easy for us. He assured the youths that nobody was marginalising anybody in the party. The former APC Secretary, Mr Nick Otunba and Chief Roland Irero who led the defectors, said the defection was a confirmation that Delta State belonged to the PDP. He said that he was not only happy to join PDP but also happy to see a mass defection from the APC to the party following the hardship the APC brought to the people. They described the APC especially at the state level as a one-man show that had no interest of the masses at heart. In another development, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Women Worldwide has endorsed the candidature of Atiku/Okowa. The group made the enforcement in a town hall meeting on Monday in Asaba.
