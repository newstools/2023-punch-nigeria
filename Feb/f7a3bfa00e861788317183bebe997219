Ahead of the 2023 general election, former Vice President Namadi Sambo, former Kaduna governors Ahmed Makarfi and Ramalan Yero have vowed to unseat the All Progressives Congress from power in the state. They made the vow at the official flag-off and presentation of flags to candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party for the Kaduna Central Senatorial District for the various positions in the elections. This was as the senatorial candidate of the party for Kaduna Central, Lawal Adamu, who recently triumphed at the Supreme Court to reclaim the seat, was officially handed over the flag of the PDP as its candidate. Sambo, who was the special guest of honour at the flag off, called on Nigerians and the good people of Kaduna State to come out en masse to vote for all the PDP candidates in the elections. On their parts, Makarfi and Yero called on all the PDP members to unite, go back to their respective polling units and deliver the party’s candidates in the polls. “We the former governors of the state will guide the governorship candidate of the party when voted accordingly,” Makarfi said. Earlier in their goodwill messages, senators Shehu Sani and Sani Bello called on Nigerians and Kaduna residents to ensure that the APC was not given the opportunity to come back to power both at the state and national levels, saying the present suffering being experienced would be a child’s play compared to what would follow should they return to power.
