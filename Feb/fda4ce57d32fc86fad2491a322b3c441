Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen on Sunday broke Cristiano Ronaldo’s four years record to become Serie A’s jump-king after a leapt of 2.58 metres during Napoli’s impressive 3-0 win away to Spezia. Osimhen achieved the incredible feat when netting his first goal – Napoli’s second of the day – against the Little Eagles at the Stadio Alberto Picco. The Nigeria international has scored many unbelievable headers during his career, but the goal against Spezia became extraordinary and could go down as a contender for the greatest headed goal in football history. After a goalless first half, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia gave Luciano Spalletti’s side the lead after converting from the penalty spot before Osimhen added the game’s second in the 68th minute with a remarkable effort. The 24-year-old produced a staggering 71cm leap and reached a height of 8.47ft (2.58m) – higher than the crossbar (8ft) – before heading past Spezia goalkeeper Bartłomiej Drągowski. And according to Corriere dello Sport, Osimhen, with that jump, climbed to a height of 2.58 metres – a mark typical of elite NBA stars. In doing that, Osimhen set a new Italian Serie A record, rubbing off the previous 2.56 metres mark set by Ronaldo for Juventus against Sampdoria in 2019. It is also a new personal career high for Osimhen whose previous mark was at 2.52m set against Torino at the Diego Maradona Stadium last season. The world record of 2.62m set by Ugandan defender Bevis Mugabi in the Scottish Championship in January 2021, however, remains intact. Osimhen has now scored 16 in Serie A goals this season, the most he has ever managed in a single season in his career.
