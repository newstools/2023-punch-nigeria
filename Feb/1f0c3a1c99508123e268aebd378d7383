A Karu Upper Area Court, sitting in Abuja, on Thursday, sentenced a 20-year-old man, Idris Abba, to six months imprisonment for belonging to a gang of thieves. The News Agency of Nigeria reported that the convict, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to the charges. The judge, Ishaq Hassan, however, gave the convict an option of N13,000 fine and warned him to desist from criminal activities. Earlier, the prosecution counsel, Olarewaju Osho, told the court that on February 16, the convict was seen conducting himself in a suspicious manner. Osho added that the convict was also seen in possession of a police identity card belonging to one Inspector Iware Obeten. He said the offence was contrary to the Penal Code.
