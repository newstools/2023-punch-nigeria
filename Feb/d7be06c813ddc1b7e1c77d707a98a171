Kano State Labour Party governorship candidate, Bashir Bashir, has defected to the All Progressives Congress, saying he was sidelined by the party. He, therefore, pledged his support for the presidential candidate of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. While announcing his defection, Bashir said, “You will recall that on January 27, 2023, we issued a press release in which we expressed our concern that neither I as the Kano State governorship candidate nor any of my colleagues and associates were consulted on important decisions in the Labour Party. “Our views were not sought, our opinions not taken, and our voices not heard. There was a complete absence of a collaborative relationship. As a coalition of Labour Party governorship, senatorial and House of Representatives, House of Assembly candidates, chairman and members of the Presidential Campaign Council, members of the Governorship Campaign Council and Zonal and State Coordinators, we have decided to endorse the candidacy of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.”
