The Bauchi State Labour Party campaign director, Alhassan Bawu, has dumped the presidential candidate of the party, Peter Obi, for the Peoples Democratic Party’s candidate, Atiku Abubakar. This is coming barely three weeks before the presidential election slated to hold on February 25. Speaking with journalists on Tuesday in Bauchi, Bawu said his defection to PDP was to support Atiku after he and other LP leaders in the North-East noticed that they may be wasting their votes for Obi. He disclosed that the defectors believed Atiku had the capacity to lead Nigeria. Bawu said the LP lacked structure at the ward, local and state levels, hence their decision to defect to PDP. He continued, “We believe the LP is not strong enough to win a single seat in the North-East. “We are officially declaring that all the North-East executives of the Labour Party are defecting to PDP to support Atiku. “We don’t want to waste our votes, and we want to use this time to mobilise votes to who has the capacity to win the election,” he maintained.
