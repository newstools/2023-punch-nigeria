The Rivers State Government on Tuesday said it had re-issued an approval for the Peoples Democratic Party to use the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium in the state to host its presidential campaign rally. The state governor, Nyesom Wike, at the PDP campaign rally in Ogu/Bolo Local Government Area said the approval has been re-issued to the National Working Committee of the PDP after pleas from many persons. On January 31, the Rivers State Government withdrew the initial approval of February 11 on the grounds that credible intelligence and recent development proved that the PDP Presidential Campaign Organisation was working in collaboration with the All Progressives Congress in the state. The state government said the PDP campaign was intending to share the approved facility with the APC, whose activities, they claimed are characterised by violence Meanwhile, speaking on the crisis in the PDP, the governor said the comment by the National Chairman of the party, Iyorchia Ayu that a member of the G5 visited him was false. He added that no member of the G5 governors, who are advocating for southern presidency would visit Ayu, adding that nobody could blackmail the G5 governors to drop the political advocacy for Southern presidency further insisting that nobody can chase them out of the party they built. Apart from Mr Wike, other governors who are members of the G5 are Samuel Ortom (Benue), Ifeanyi Ugwanyi (Enugu), Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia) and Seyi Makinde (Oyo). They have consistently demanded the resignation of Ayu as a prerequisite to support the presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar.
