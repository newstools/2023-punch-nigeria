The Director-General of the Labour Party Kaduna State Governorship Campaign Council, Tsahiru Bako, on Saturday, said only God can stop the party’s governorship candidate, Jonathan Asake, from winning the March 11 governorship election in the state. According to the DG, Asake is on a divine project, noting that the LP is not just a party but a movement whose time has come. Bako also likened the LP governorship candidate to a ‘wind’ that nobody could stop, noting that any attempt to halt Asake from winning the governorship election in the state would only amount to working against God. “Thank God that this time around, it’s a movement, not a party. Anybody that is going to stop the wind from blowing knows that he’s contesting against God because it’s God that makes the wind blow. “So, we are so sure that just like you could not stop the wind from blowing to bring the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari(retd.) in 2015, you will not stop the wind that will bring Asake as the governor of Kaduna State,” he said. This was just as the DG claimed that the candidate was far more qualified than counterparts other parties vying for the exalted seat in the state. The other candidates in the race are the All Progressives Congress governorship candidate and incumbent senator representing Kaduna Central, Uba Sani, a former House of Representatives member and the Peoples Democratic Party’s governorship candidate, Alhaji Isah Kudan, and the Action Democratic Party’s candidate, who is also an in-law to President Buhari, Alhaji Sani Sha’aban, among others.
