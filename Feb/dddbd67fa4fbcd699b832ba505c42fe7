The Group Managing Director, SystemSpecs Holdings, John Obaro, has said youths must be taught how to use technology to add value to society. He said this during a roundtable conversation on ‘National Economic Outlook’, which was co-hosted by the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria and B. Adedipe Associates Limited. A statement quoted Obaro as acknowledging the difficulties businesses in Nigeria were confronted with, the current state of the economy, and its overbearing effects on businesses across the nation. He stated that innovation had progressed to the point where artificial intelligence, for example, ChatGPT, could be used to drive proficiency when used appropriately. Obaro said, “The demands of the modern world go beyond an educational system where students are just taught to regurgitate the concepts they are given in the classroom. “Technology has advanced to a level where there are smarter approaches to doing almost everything. As a result, we must ensure that we are preparing young stars to add value to society by leveraging existing technology.” “The demands of the modern world go beyond an educational system where students are just taught to regurgitate the concepts they are given in the classroom. “Technology has advanced to a level where there are smarter approaches to doing almost everything.
