The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Wednesday, congratulated the new president of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Joe Ajaero, saying the new administration will write a new chapter for the union. Buhari’s congratulatory message was contained in a statement signed by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, titled ‘President Buhari welcomes Ajaero’s emergence as NLC leader, charges him to be a partner in progress.’ The PUNCH reports that Ajaero who until his emergence as president was the deputy national president of the labour union emerged as the NLC national president at the 13th National Delegates’ Conference of the labour union in Abuja. Ajaero made history by emerging unopposed as the union’s president for four years, succeeding Ayuba Wabba. Responding to the development, the President hailed the National Executive Committee of the NLC on the success of the congress that produced the new leadership. He said, “After many years of hard work and struggles, the selflessness with which Ajaero dedicated himself today paid off. “His journey in the Labour movement has been a remarkable one, marked by many important milestones. “This victory that emerged from a rancour-free congress is a mark of the strength of democracy in the nation’s labour movement. “Today, as he rises to the highest position in the NLC, it is our hope and desire that he will use the position to write a new chapter of progress for all workers and the labour movement in the country and the continent in general.” Buhari also expressed the hope that Ajaero and his team will continue to be partners to the regime in fulfilling the aspirations of Nigerians. He congratulated the outgoing president, Ayuba Wabba, for the successful completion of his tenure as the head of Nigerian workers, wishing him the best in his future undertakings.
