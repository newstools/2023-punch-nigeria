The governorship candidate of the Zenith Labour Party has condemned the Monday violent disruption of the campaign rally of the All Progressives Congress by thugs in the  Umunachi, Omuma Local Government Area of the state. The Monday attack caused panic in the community, with some natives scampering for safety. The APC chairman in Omuma LGA, Onyekachi Ojiegbe, had described the attack as an eyesore, noting that party’s vehicles and other valuables were vandalised. Reacting on Tuesday, the ZLP Chairman in Rivers State,  Ben  Ogbogbula, in a statement in Port Harcourt, said the attack that left vehicles and property destroyed  was a return to the Stone Age. He stated,”Let us reiterate that violence is never within the contemplation of democracy and those who indulge in such barbarism that subjects the freedom of society and the citizens of the republic to terror and fear have no place in our civilisation. “Our democracy has evolved and those who still do not understand that Nigerians would not give up their democratic rights to thugs and political bandits should wake up to the realities. “No amount of premeditated attacks such as witnessed in Omuma LGA would cow the people to give up on their rights under the Constitution and the law. “As an opposition party, we sympathise with the APC and the Tonye Cole/Innocent Barikor governorship team over the losses they may have incurred. “The governor should tone down his fiery, confrontational political outbursts to eliminate the feverish political climate already created. “The Commissioner of Police, Mr Okon Effiong, should redouble efforts to prevent further attacks on political rallies in the state and ensure perpetrators are brought to book.”
