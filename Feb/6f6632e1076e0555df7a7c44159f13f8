The Inter-Party Advisory Council, Cross River State, has given the Independent National Electoral Commission 24 hours ultimatum to allow political parties to inspect the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System machines in the state. The umbrella body of the 18 registered political parties in the state warned that elections would not hold in the state if they were not allowed to inspect the BVAS machines. IPAC gave the ultimatum on Monday in a statement read at a press conference by the state Chairman, Anthony Bissong, as part of its demands for a credible election. “We give the INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner 24 hours to allow political parties inspect the BVAS in addition to taking full record of the IMEI number of the 3,281 BVAS machines, to reignite and renew our confidence in the commission. “We call on the National Chairman of INEC to authorise a thorough investigation of the activities of the commission in the state,” he said. He also called for the redeployment of the state Police Commissioner, Sule Balarabe, and the DCP Operations, Frank Idu, ahead of the elections. “We want the next CP upon resumption of duty to effect a comprehensive reshuffling of Divisional Police Officers across the state and especially Cross River North that has become a major flashpoint of political violence in the state.” Reacting, the Commissioner of police said, “I have no ill intention about anybody in Cross River. I will remain impartial in the discharge of my duties. I will maintain professionalism in all my activities.” IPAC also urged the 18 political parties  in the state to intensify their campaigns, be civil in their conduct and demonstrate high level sportsmanship at the end of the elections. “We urge citizens to intensify their vigilance on the process leading to the next election as the Osun State Tribunal ruling has showed clearly that human influence is capable of compromising the forthcoming elections despite the application of technology,” he added.
