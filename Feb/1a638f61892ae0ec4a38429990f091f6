The Department of State Services has confirmed the invitation of a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, Femi Fani-Kayode, over his allegation of plans by some military personnel to seize power. Fani-Kayode had in a series of tweets on Saturday claimed some military personnel met with the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, to scuttle the 2023 polls as well as plot a coup. The military had since denied the allegations, pledging its loyalty to the constitution and the democratic system in place. On Monday morning, Fani-Kayode, however, announced that he had been invited by the DSS, but said he would honour the invitation because he had nothing to fear. In a short message sent to our correspondent, the spokesperson for the DSS, Peter Afunanya, said Fani-Kayode arrived at the service office at 9 am on Monday. He said, ” Chief Femi Fani-Kayode has been with the DSS since 9 am today 13/02/23. In response to the invitation extended to him by the Service. Later, please.”
