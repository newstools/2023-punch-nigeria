The lawmaker representing Enugu East Senatorial District, Chimaroke Nnamani, has insisted that he won’t rescind his decision to support the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, as president in the forthcoming general elections. The former Enugu State governor, a member of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, said his continued support for Tinubu was because southern politicians in the PDP had agreed to back any candidate from the sub-region for the presidency, his right to freedom of choice, among others. The PUNCH on January 20 reported that the PDP suspended Nnamani for alleged anti-party activities. But, in a statement made available to our correspondent on Monday in Abuja, Nnamani described his suspension as a peculiar mess that will collapse in no time. He said, “My suspension order was ill-conceived and unwarranted. “My right to a fair hearing was violated because I was not informed or invited to speak on the matter of my suspension. “My decision to pitch tent with Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu was necessitated by the PDP’s refusal to comply with its own constitution to wit; those key political offices should at all times be rotated between the South and North to guarantee harmony, peace, fairness, equity and justice. “As it is now, there is no fairness, justice and equity in the PDP because both the presidential candidate and the national chairman are from the same region. “I am only exercising my right of freedom of choice and association. On this score, I stand with Tinubu.” Senator Nnamani further urged the leadership of the PDP to put its house in order, insisting that his suspension by the party lacked both moral and constitutional backing.
