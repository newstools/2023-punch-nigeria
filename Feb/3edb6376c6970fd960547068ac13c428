As the nation prepares for the 2023 general elections, the Gombe State Coordinator of the National Youth Service Corps, Mrs Ada Imoni, has called on the 2023 Batch ‘A’ Stream I corps members not to be involved in partisan politics. She made this known during her debriefing at the NYSC temporary orientation camp in the Amada area of the state. She maintained that corps members must make it a point of duty to give their best as ad hoc staff of the Independent National Electoral Commission. “It is pertinent that you do not drag the good name of the scheme in the mud by taking bribes or conniving with politicians to mar the quest for a successful election. For as many of you that will be participating, I call on you to make us proud by giving free, fair and credible elections, by the grace of God,” she said. Speaking on the cashless policy, the NYSC coordinator disclosed that arrangements had been concluded with the Gombe Line and Gombawa Transport Motors to convey corps members to their places of primary assignment and states of relocation as the case may be. The coordinator said, “Transport fares will be paid through their Point of Sale machines to ease the stress of the cashless policy.” She said posting had been concluded based on four critical areas of the scheme which are agriculture, rural development, education and healthcare delivery.
Imoni lectured the corps members on community development service, respect for the culture and traditions of their host communities, hate speech, biometrics clearance, channel of communication. Our correspondent reports that no fewer than 839 corps members were at the debriefing.
