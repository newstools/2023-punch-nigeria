The Rotary Club District 9110 has stressed the importance of public awareness of the need to ensure a cleaner and more sustainable environment. The District Governor, Omotunde Lawson, stated this on Friday during the 2022-2023 Planet Earth Award and recognition day held at the Rotary Centre, Ikeja GRA. Lawson said, “We advocate a safer and more sustainable environment; an environment that is free from pollution. We create awareness of what we all need to do to keep our environment safe for human existence and this involves tree-planting exercises and keeping the environment clean. “This is why we have appointed individuals known as Planet Earth Ambassadors who work with government officials and institutions to raise public awareness about the environment and influence policies that will ensure that the environment is clean and drains are de-clogged.” Also speaking at the event, the Chairman, District Committee on Environment/Planet Earth, Isola Ogunsola, said, “We are Rotarians first, but clogged those of us in the Planet Earth Ambassadors group, we take it upon ourselves to champion the cause of advocacy and partake in the cleanliness of our environment. “We sensitise others who are not environmentally friendly and we will also be involved in projects and programmes that have to do with the environment all year round.”
