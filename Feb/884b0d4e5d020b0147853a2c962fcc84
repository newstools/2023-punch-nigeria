The Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Abubakar Al-Kanemi, has urged politicians to adopt the politics-without-bitternes style of the Second Republic leader and presidential candidate of the defunct Great Nigeria Peoples Party, the late Waziri Ibrahim, as they contest in the forthcoming elections. He also said a no-victor-no-vanquished relationship should be sustained after the elections for the sake of the peace and progress of the country. The monarch said this while at his palace when the Peoples Democratic Party Borno Central senatorial candidate, Jibrin Tatabe, paid him a visit in Maiduguri. “Whether the APC or PDP or any other party, you are Nigerian politicians working for the peace and progress of the country,” the monarch said, urging, “you should, therefore, play politics without bitterness, like the late Waziri Ibrahim.” He urged the senatorial candidate to fight for the employment of the teeming Borno youths if he wins the election. Tatabe, who launched his electioneering campaign after the homage to the Shehu, told newsmen that he had always been a staunch advocate of politics without bitterness. “My committment to politics without bitterness is unshaken,” he stressed, adding that he did not believe in any form of confrontation in the game of politics. He said his main agenda is seeking jobs for the teeming youths, the empowerment of women and the vulnerable, and the education of the massive population of out-of-school children in the state, if he wins the election.
