The Labour Party in Ekiti State on Tuesday dismissed the purported collapse of the structures of the party in the South West to the All Progressives Congress. LP State Chairman, Odunayo Okunade, said the said collapse of structure was untrue and “a failed plot to distract party faithful and the general public from their support for LP presidential candidate, Mr Peter Obi”. One Mr Banji Omotoso, had said on Monday that he, in his capacity as Southwest Chairman of the party, had led the entire LP structures in the geo-political zone to APC. But the LP State chairman, in a statement in Ado Ekiti titled, ‘Banji Omotoso and his Cohorts are Unknown in LP’, said that those who paraded themselves as leaders of the party in Southwest were impersonators. He said, “Our attention has been drawn to one Banji Omotoso’s claims that the South West LP has collapsed its structures in the zone to APC. “This is not only untrue, but a vicious claim by dubious political vultures who are out to distract the Obedient movement in a bid to make unholy financial gains in camps that can accommodate them”. “It must be noted that the LP came in contact with this shameless character when he came on board to use our platform and its ideologies for his selfish gains in 2020. “Similarly, these same political scavengers led by the same Omotoso equally exhibited this trait on the 28th May, 2022 when they impersonated the LP leadership in Ekiti State and were consequently silenced by the party. “In this present case, the leadership of the party is taking this matter up seriously and legally against him and his derailed fold. “No amount of campaign of calumny can distract the LP obedient faithful and the general public from their support for Mr Peter Obi.  “Members of the public are hereby enjoined to disregard Omotoso’s claim and be focused on our mission to enthrone Mr Peter Obi as President, Federal of Nigeria in the February 25 presidential election,” he stated.
