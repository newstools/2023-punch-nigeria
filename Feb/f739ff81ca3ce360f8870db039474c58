A former Executive Secretary of the National Health Insurance Scheme, Usman Yusuf, has said that none of the northern governors of the All Progressives Congress will deliver their states for the party’s presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, in the forthcoming elections. The ex-NHIS secretary said this on Monday when he appeared as a guest on Channels Television’s The 2023 Verdict. Yusuf claimed that Tinubu’s politics is only regional to the South-West, especially in Lagos State, where he described the APC flag bearer as “alpha and omega,” insisting that Tinubu had no experience in national politics. He said, “None of the APC governors in the North, has the goodwill of the people to deliver anything to him (Tinubu)… None,” “His inexperience is showing,” adding that it is only in Lagos “where he is alpha and omega, nobody challenges him.” He also said that Tinubu is not talking to the people in the North but only sub-contracting his campaign to praise singers and APC governors. “When it comes to the campaign hosting, he only dances and leaves,” Yusuf said. He further said that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), had squandered all his influence and goodwill internationally and nationally and as such might not birth his dream of handing over to a candidate from the APC, adding that only the people’s wish would prevail.
