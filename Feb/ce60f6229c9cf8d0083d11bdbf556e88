Again, the Catholic Priest, Rev. Fr. Hyacint Alia, has been declared winner of the rescheduled governorship primary election of the All Progressives Congress in Benue State. The Appeal Court sitting in Makurdi, the state capital, had last week ordered a rerun primary in 11 of the 23 local government areas of the state to determine the authentic candidate of the party. The Appeal Court made the order while giving judgment on the case brought before it by one of the aspirants, Prof. Terhemba Shija, and added that result from the rerun be added to the existing result of the 12 local government areas. The appellate court on the same day dismissed another appeal brought before it by another governorship aspirant, Senator Barnabas Gemade as statute barred. While the two aspirants were reported to have proceeded to the Supreme Court, two cases initiated by another governorship aspirant, Mike Aondoaaka, and the Peoples Democratic Party are still pending before Appeal Court in Abuja. Declaring the result of the rescheduled governorship primary, the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Basheer Lado, said Alia polled 410,682 votes to beat his closet rival, Sam Ode, who polled 22,319. Senator Lado explained that the total number of registered voters of the party for the election in the 23 LGAs of the state was 868,010. The chairman of the rescheduled governorship primary gave the breakdown of votes garnered by each of the aspirants in the 23 LGs of the state. According to him, Mathias Ibuan polled 14,593 votes, Bernard Yisa, 581 votes; Senator Barnabas Gemade, 5,125 votes; Terlumun Ikya, 2,851 votes and Barr Sam Ode polled 22,319 votes. Others are Rev. Fr. Hyacinth Alia, 410,682 votes; Michael Kaase Aondoakaa (SAN), 3,815 votes; Godwin Tyoachimin, 1,139 votes; Steven Lawani, 21,172 votes; Prof Terhemba Shija, 2,217 votes; Mlanga, 219 votes; Terwase Orbunde, 1,391 votes, while Herman Hembe polled 638 votes. Senator Lado therefore said, “With this document before me, I hereby declare Rev Fr Hyacinth Iormem Alia who scored a total number of 410,682 votes, having scored the highest number of votes as the winner of this election.” Shortly after the declaration of the results, the state chapter of the party held a special congress where it affirmed the candidacy of Rev Fr Hyacinth Alia as duly elected to fly the party’s flag in next month’s election. Meanwhile, Chairman of the appeal panel, Umar Kolo, said the committee would commence sitting by noon on Friday to entertain complaints from aspirants that were not satisfied with the outcome of the election.
