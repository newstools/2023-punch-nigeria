Manchester United have missed their chance to level defending Premier League champions Manchester City, as they were held in a 2-2 draw by Leeds United on Wednesday night. Leeds, who are without a manager, launched the scoresheet in the very first minute of game time, as Wilfred Gnonto’s right footed shot from outside of the box, easily found the back of the net. United went into half time one goal down, and at the return from the break, United’s defender, Raphael Varane, doubled the scoreline for Leeds with an own goal in the 48th minute. Fighting back however, United’s forward Marcus Rashford, put in one for the team in the 62nd minute, which was doubled by Jordan Sancho in the 70th minute, levelling the scoreline for United. Failing to secure a win, the Red Devils remain in third place on the league table with 43 points, two points behind rivals Manchester City who sit in second place with 45 points. Leeds sit in 16th place with 19 points.
