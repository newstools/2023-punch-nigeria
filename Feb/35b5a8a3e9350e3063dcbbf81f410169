The Independent National Electoral Commission has commenced the upload of polling unit results of the 2023 presidential results on its website. As of 11:35pm on Saturday, 4,102 polling unit results, out of the 176,846, had been uploaded. A civil society group, Yiaga Africa, had earlier expressed concern over the failure of INEC to upload results on its result viewing portal hours after the counting of votes had begun in some polling units across the country. The portal, known as INEC Rev, was designed by the commission for presiding officers to upload results from polling units. In a tweet made on its official handle @YIAGA, the electoral monitoring group said it was “deeply concerned” that results had yet to be uploaded to the site, noting that voting and counting had ended in several polling units. The tweet read, “Update: Yiaga Africa is deeply concerned with the delay in uploading polling unit results for the presidential election on the INEC election result portal. As of 7pm on election day, no result was uploaded after voting and counting ended in several polling units. #NigeriaDecides2023”. The civil society organisation also posted a photo of the INEC website, showing that no result had been uploaded from all the polling units across the country.
