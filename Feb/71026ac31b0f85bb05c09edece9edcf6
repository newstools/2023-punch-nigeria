The Nigerian Institute of Town Planners has called on political parties to review their manifestos to reflect the critical role of physical planning in their agenda. According to a statement, the National President of NTIP, Nathaniel Atebije, made the call in Abuja at the 2023 quarterly press conference of the institute. He advised that as the 2023 general election draws closer, there was a need for political parties to place the issue of town planning on the front burner to curtail the rising cases of disasters in the country. “We recommend to the political parties to review their manifestos to reflect the critical role of physical planning in their agenda. “There is need to also carry out development in line with the provisions of the Nigerian Urban and Regional Planning, 1992 as amended in 2004,” he said. Atebije disclosed that the institute was working on a holistic document to be presented to the political parties soon. The document, he said, would address the issue of urban planning and disasters in the country. The president also stressed the need for government at all levels to immediately begin sensitisation and installation of measures to minimise flooding before the rainy season begins this year.
