The Kano  State governorship candidate on the platform of the Labour Party, Bashir Bashir, on Sunday evening in a surprise move, dumped his party for the ruling All Progressives Congress. On January 21, the governorship candidate staged a boycott of the party’s presidential rally held in Kano, alongside the chairman of the Presidential Campaign Council, Mohammed Zarewa; the state coordinator of Peter Obi’s campaign, Balarabe Wakili, and a member of the presidential campaign council, Idris Dambazau. A source close to the candidate, who confirmed the defection of Bashir, alongside other LP leaders, to the APC on Sunday, blamed their defection to the exclusion of major northern stakeholders from its decision making process, as well as lack of clear-cut direction on the interest of northern Nigeria.
