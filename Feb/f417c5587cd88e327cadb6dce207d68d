The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has announced suspension of its ongoing 2023 Direct Entry registrations. The board in a statement by its Head, Public Affairs and Protocol, Fabian Benjamin, explained that the registration which commenced on Monday, February 20, was suspended with effect from Tuesday, February 21, 2023. The suspension, according to a statement issued by JAMB on Tuesday, is to enable the deployment of certain measures, which are designed to better serve prospective candidates. The statement said, “A new date and fresh registration procedure, which will include the upload of JAMB Admission Letter in the case of OND and NCE, admission letter issued by universities in the case of university diploma, and admission letter issued by A’ Level examination bodies (IJMBE, JUPEB, etc.), would be announced in due course so that candidates could proceed to JAMB offices nationwide to register.” The PUNCH had earlier reported that JAMB had commenced the DE registration on Monday, February 20, 2023, and had slated it to end on Thursday, April 20, 2023. “Candidates are also to note that only JAMB offices are approved to register them for Direct Entry,” the statement added.
