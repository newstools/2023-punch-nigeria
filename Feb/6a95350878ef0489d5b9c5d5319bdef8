The All Progressives Congress in Osun State has said the administration of Governor Ademola Adeleke has nothing to show as achievements to mark its 100 days in office. This was contained in a statement signed by the APC acting Chairman, Mr Tajudeen Lawal, obtained in Osogbo on Monday. The APC boss accused the Adeleke administration of plans to loot the Osun treasury. Lawal further said, “We are aware that the current government has concluded plans to fleece the state of its resources through re-commissioning of projects the previous government of the APC had already installed for public use. “Specifically, the Adeleke administration is desperate to shore up its hugely kwashiorkored image by repainting some of the legacy public schools and primary health centres built by the Administration of former Governor Gboyega Oyetola.” But responding, Director of Media of Osun PDP, Oladele Olabamiji, said APC was surprised by the achievements recorded by Adeleke in his first 100 days in office. Olabamiji said, “It is permitted for the party to make noise. They are surprised that an administration can set for itself developmental agenda within 100 days. We are not bothered by their noise. They have been doing this since the 100 days agenda was made public. “Our major concern is to ensure that our people get value for their mandate which they surrender to Governor Adeleke. The APC is free to embark on their propaganda.”
