  The Independent National Electoral Commission in Ondo State, on Tuesday, disclosed that a total of 17,562 ad hoc staff would be deployed for the general election coming up on Saturday. Speaking at a security meeting in Akure, the Acting Resident Electoral Commissioner in Ondo State, Mr Oyekola Oyelana, expressed the readiness of the commission to conduct a free, fair, and credible election on Saturday. He said, “The commission in Ondo state is deploying 17,562 ad hoc personnel to serve in various capacities in Saturday’s elections. “INEC has been sensitising people to the use of BVAS in the election. BVAS is going to be used for accreditation alongside thumbprint and facial (accreditation). We don’t have any problem with this.” Oyelami allayed the fear of the people on whether the election would be held in the face of the current crisis across the country as he declared that the election would be held as planned. “The INEC does not have any problem. The arrangement has been made to make sure that this election goes as scheduled,” he stressed. In his own remarks, the State Commissioner of Police, Mr Oyeyemi Oyediran, disclosed that 7,000 security men would be at work for the election. According to him, security officers to be deployed include policemen, men of the Nigerian Army, officers of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Nigeria Immigration Service, and the Nigeria Navy among others. The police boss said, “Over 7,000 combined security personnel are to cover the election. We are assuring the public that we are ready for the success of the forthcoming elections. “I want to inform the public that they should rest assured that the poll is going to be peaceful and we are all ready for that purpose. Thuggery alongside other related vices will not be allowed.”
