The All Progressives Congress Presidential Campaign Council in Rivers State said it had mobilised about 50,000 persons across the state to attend the rally of Bola Tinubu in Port Harcourt. The Chairman of the Local Organising Committee in Rivers State, Chief Tony Okocha, disclosed this in Port Harcourt on Sunday shortly after inspecting the venue for the rally. The APC presidential rally is scheduled for Wednesday, February 15, 2023 at the Yakubu Gowon Stadium in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital. Governor Nyesom Wike approved the venue last week, where he waived the N5m non-refundable fee. Okocha said all was set for what he described as the mother of all presidential rallies, adding that the committee had put everything in place, including security to ensure a successful rally. “We have come here to inspect the facilities at this venue which has been approved by the Rivers State Government. “One of the reasons why we came is to also assure our presidential candidate that Rivers State is upbeat and that we are ready for him on the February 15. “You can see things for yourselves what we have done so far and we want to assure our presidential candidate and the PCC at the national level that we are upbeat, “he stated. When asked if the division in the state APC would not affect the rally, he said the party members were united in their drive to ensure a successful and hitch-free rally. Okocha said, “Even though nothing has been advanced to us, we have taken the bull by the horns, and as a people, we feel that no attempt and nobody will attempt to sabotage what the APC is doing in Rivers State. “So, we have put resources together and we have also mobilised a minimum of 50,000 persons from the 23 local government areas of the state to attend the rally at this particular venue.” The state PCC LOC chairman disclosed that with the mobilisation and enlightenment carried out and the feedback received so far across the state, Asiwaju Tinubu can win Rivers State.
