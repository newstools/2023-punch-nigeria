 Newcastle Manager, Eddie Howe, has expressed fears for former Newcastle United player Christian Atsu over reports bothering on the Hatayspor player’s welfare after earthquakes hit Turkey and Syria. Atsu, Bournemouth winger was reported to be missing in the aftermath of the tremors. More than 21,000 people have been reported dead after southern Turkey and northern Syria were struck by earthquakes on Monday. There appeared to be a positive update on Atsu when Hatayspor vice-president Mustafa Ozat said he had been “removed from the wreckage’’ on Tuesday. According to him, the club cannot confirm his whereabouts the following day and said there was no update on Atsu’s condition. Howe had Atsu and his family in his thoughts ahead of Saturday’s meeting between the winger’s two former clubs. “I really enjoyed working with Christian, a great lad, great player. Our thoughts are with him and his family. “We hope for some good news, we hope he’s okay, but we’re really concerned for him and his welfare this week. “It has been difficult because there have been conflicting stories coming out about his whereabouts, so it’s been very tough. I can’t imagine how his family is feeling but from the bottom of our hearts, we wish him well and hope there’s a positive ending,’’ he said. NAN
