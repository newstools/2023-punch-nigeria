Lift Above Poverty Organisation says it has disbursed over N70bn to 262,977 clients since 2007 under its LAPO Rural Development Initiative. The Executive Director of LAPO-NGO, Honestus Obadiora, made the disclosure on Monday at the annual media forum in Benin City. Obadiora said the loan was disbursed to clients in 303 branches across 22 states in the country. He also disclosed that under the LARDI initiative, N23.5bn was disbursed to improve the livelihood of rural farmers as well as support micro businesses between January and December 2022. He added that the mandate of LARDI was to improve the income, food security and general living conditions of rural households, particularly women-headed households and youths. He said, “LAPO has disbursed over N70bn to 262,977 clients since 2007 under its LAPO Rural Development Initiative. “We are delighted that the beneficiaries who were hitherto subsistence farmers and small scale business owners have expanded their farmlands and businesses with improved income for family upkeep and savings for the future. “LAPO addresses challenges limiting farmers’ productivity and income as well as business expansion and growth such as non-availability of inputs for improved farm yield and limited access to finance.” According to him, the organisation built the capacity of rural farmers and business owners through on-farm demonstration, workshop and training programmes.
