A coalition of Civil Society Organisations has warned security agencies against arresting the General Overseer of the Dunamis Church, Paul Enenche, and other clerics. The All Progressives Congress Presidential Campaign Council had on Monday called on the Department of State Services to invite Enenche, claiming the cleric delivered an “inciting sermon” last Sunday. But the coalition, made up of the Arewa Youths for Peace and Security, the Pentecostal Association of Nigeria, the Salute Nigeria Initiative, and the Global Network for Sustainable Development, said speaking out against electoral malpractices and rigging, should not be taken as inciting violence. Speaking on behalf of the groups, the National Coordinator of GNSD, Phil Roberts, said if allowed to stand, the call could be extended to other clerics who made public their preferred candidates in the February 25 elections. He said, “We, therefore, take the statement by Dele Alake, Special Adviser, Media and Communications, for the All Progressive Congress about the arrest of the revered cleric, Paul Enenche, the Senior Pastor of Dunamis International Gospel Centre, and others, as a direct affront to democracy and freedom of speech in this country. “We dismiss the statement as an unwarranted threat to his life as well as a breach of his fundamental human right.” Roberts stressed that as a citizen of the country and religious leader, Enenche had the freedom to express his opinions on matters of national importance. “The church, as a critical member of society, shares heavily in the burden of bad governance and is not expected to watch the nation gravitate towards imminent disasters without speaking out. “We will not allow our fathers of faith to be intimidated. We believe this may extend beyond him if he is allowed to stand because of the choice they made before the election was held,” he added.
