A former presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, Chief Charles Udeogaranya, has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission to be transparent with details on polling units ahead of the forthcoming general elections. In a statement in Abuja on Thursday, Udeogaranya asked the commission to explain why 240 polling units were dropped barely one year after it created 56,872 fresh polling units His position came on the heels of INEC’s disclosure that it identified 240 out of the 176,846 polling units nationwide where elections would not hold on February 25 and March 11, 2023. The INEC chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, during a meeting with the 18 registered political parties stated that the commission discovered that the polling units had no registered voters. In June 2022, the commission created additional 56,872 polling units to expand voter access drives. But Udeogaranya claimed that the commission was not telling Nigerians all it knew regarding its decision to close the affected polling units. He urged the commission to come clean with details on the new polling units it created for public scrutiny and verification. Udeogaranya said that the 240 discarded PUs were insignificant compared to the over 56,000 ones created by the commission. He stated, “Nigerians would like to know how all those polling units were populated. We would like to know who they are and assess the copies of their registers and the PVC collection records for fuller public interrogation.”
