Scores of commercial motorcyclists, also known as okada riders, on Wednesday took to the streets of Akure, the state capital, in protest against the scarcity of the new naira notes while old notes were being rejected by commercial banks. The okada riders barricaded the Oba Adesida Road at the popular First Bank Roundabout chanting various solidarity songs, causing a traffic logjam on the road for some hours. All commercial banks located in the area swiftly closed operations for fear of being attacked. The protest scene was less than 500 metres away from the Akure branch of the Central Bank of Nigeria.
