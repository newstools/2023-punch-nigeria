  The Nigerian Customs Service, Kebbi State Command has intercepted 8,975 litres of petrol loaded in 25-litre kegs from suspected smugglers. The Customs Area Controller, Comptroller B Oramalugo, in a chat with journalists, said the command intercepted different items worth N91,518,928 duty paid value within three weeks. Items seized by the command include 189 bags of foreign parboiled rice, 71 bags of imported sugar, 42 bales of second-hand clothing and 36 sacks of used shoes. Others include 74 cartons of bleaching cream, 110 solar batteries, 105 cartons of medicine, seven used vehicles as means of conveyance as well as one tanker truck suspected to have been smuggled Into the country in contravention of Federal Government extant policy, prohibiting the importation of vehicles through land borders. The Comptroller however revealed that the seized PMS is going to be auctioned immediately after the briefing. “It is disheartening that in spite of the humongous amount paid by government to make PMS available to citizens at a reasonable price, some unscrupulous citizens choose to divert the product to our neighbouring countries for their selfish financial benefits,” he said. He said the command is equipped to carry out its duty as enshrined in Customs and Excise Management Act.
