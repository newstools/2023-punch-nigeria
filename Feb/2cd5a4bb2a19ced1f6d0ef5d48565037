Mikano Motors has launched a new product, Changan Auto, into the Nigerian automobile market. In a press briefing in Lagos, the General Manager of Mikano Motors, Ralph Haidar, said, “Mikano Motors’ partnership with Changan Auto is a powerful alliance that will further change the landscape of automobile ownership in Nigeria, in the wake of the success of the Geely brand. “We are expecting around 15 models from this brand, which will be complementary to our line-up from Geely Auto, Maxus and ZNA.” The company said Mikano Motors/Changan would be offering a six-year/ 200,000km (whichever comes first) warranty to all its new customers while offering up to a five-year warranty to existing Changan owners. Mikano Motors promised that with 15 models of Changan, there would be a car to suit everyone’s needs. “This is the first of its kind in all of Africa and one of the reasons why the Changan brand is performing well in some West African countries, especially of note, Ivory Coast. This is also true for many Gulf countries like Qatar, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia where they offer even higher warranties. “As a leading global provider of quality automobile sales and services, with a clear understanding of producing quality vehicles and considering the disposable income of auto buyers declines as a result of the global economic recession and other domestic factors, we understand that businesses and individuals need cars that combine durability, affordability, as well as luxury and technology, which is what Changan and Mikano Motors are known to provide to its customers,” Haidar asserted.
