The Nigeria Customs Service has disclosed that it intercepted 450 drums of calcium carbide (used for making explosives), 68 pieces of military camouflage, cannabis sativa and others worth N517m in January. The Customs Area Controller in charge of the Federal Operations Unit Zone A, Ikeja, Hussein Ejibunnu, while addressing journalists at the unit on Wednesday, said that the explosives weighed 106 kilogrammes each were intercepted in Ijebu-Ode en route Aba in Abia State. He also said the explosives have a duty-paid value of N24m. Ejibunnu said within the period under review, the sum of N86m was recovered through the issuance of demand notices for underpaid Customs duties. The Customs Zone A boss stated that the carbides were still under detention pending when the importer provided the necessary documents. “This is calcium carbide about 450 drums weighing 106kg each with a street value of N24m. The status of this is still under detention because the owner said he has End-User-Certificate for it, so we are waiting for the presentation of the EUC. It was intercepted at Ijebu-Ode on its way to Aba.” He said the failure of the importer to produce the EUC within the time frame, the service would persecute the importer. According to him, “It is important we note that this is part of the bye products for making bombs.” He added that Customs officials were on the lookout for prohibited imports. “We have a time frame of 30 days. We have a suspect with us. Let him get us the necessary documents. As soon as he gets the documents then there is no problem.” “11 suspects were arrested in connection with some of the wares. While the Federal High Court had convicted three people for the crime of smuggling,” he declared.
