The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, has hinted his readiness to work with the candidates of the New Nigerian People Party, Rabiu Kwankwaso and Labour Party’s Peter Obi after meeting with the duo to support his ambition in the forthcoming election. Atiku made this known in a 15-minute interview with BBC Hausa service on Tuesday. Speaking with the interviewer in the Hausa language, Atiku said both Obi and Kwankwaso are not a threat to his chances of winning at the February 25 poll. “Although, I see no threat in any of them but we are in talks, and the discussion might yield a positive result that will see one of them coming.” While fielding questions on the lingering PDP crisis, Atiku said each party has its internal crisis and theirs will not be an exemption but they are looking to solve every difference in no distant time. “Each party has its internal crisis, we are still talking with them. Most are neither in PDP nor in other parties and definitely that will not make us lose the election because we are okay with the election preparations for now. “Election now is not like in the past when a governor will dictate who to vote for, election today is in the hands of the voters,” he added.
