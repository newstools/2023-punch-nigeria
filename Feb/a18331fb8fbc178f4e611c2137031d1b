A bank customer who slumped and died at a bank in Delta State has been identified. The PUNCH had reported that a bank customer slumped and died after standing in a queue for long hours at a bank in the Agbor area of Delta State. The deceased was said to have waited for hours to collect his Automated Teller Machine card at the bank in Ika South Local Government Area of the state. The state’s Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bright Edafe, confirmed the incident. “He was not trying to withdraw cash; he came to collect his ATM card,” the police spokesperson said. However, the deceased was identified as Mr Vincent Igweh.  Until his death, Igweh was said to be a building material merchant. The PUNCH reports that banking halls across various commercial banks in Lagos, Osun, Ekiti, and other parts of the country witnessed minimal activity as frustrated customers resorted to alternative means of cash withdrawal following the scarcity of naira notes in the banks. Checks by our correspondents revealed that while most banking halls were empty due to paucity of funds in bank vaults, large crowds had formed outside some of the few banks that were rumoured to be preparing to load their Automated Teller Machines.
