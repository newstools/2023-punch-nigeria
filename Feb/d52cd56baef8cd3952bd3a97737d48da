The Peoples Democratic Party senatorial candidate for Ekiti North senatorial district, Funso Ayeni, has said he has no godfather but political leaders whom he could learn from. Speaking in Lagos on Wednesday during a fundraising event for his campaign, he stated, “The fundraising is for my campaign. I can’t do it alone. I want to support my people. I really would like to do all the things that I have mentioned but I want support. “This is the best time to ask for the funds because we are going to hit the roads and we will be on the road for the next 14 days, trying to gather more momentum. So, I’m not asking for much, we understand the whole electoral process, we are just saying that people should be part of this conversation.” “I don’t have a godfather but I have political leaders whom I tap from from time to time to be able to gather enough momentum to navigate the storm.”
