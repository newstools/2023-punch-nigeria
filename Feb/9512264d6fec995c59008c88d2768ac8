The Central Bank of Nigeria, on Friday, listed money bouquets as a form of naira abuse. The apex bank made this known in a flier shared on its Twitter handle that listed forms of abusing the naira. Alongside money bouquet, other forms of abuse listed by the CBN are spraying, selling, squeezing and defacing. Urging citizens to report the abuse of the naira, the CBN captioned the post, “It is your civic duty to protect the naira. Report naira abuse today.” It also provided toll-free hot-lines through which the apex bank could be reached to report such activities Recall that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission had said it will arraign an actress and cosmetologist, Oluwadarasimi Omoseyin, who was arrested last Wednesday by operatives of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission, for allegedly abusing the naira. The 31-year-old was arrested after a video of her spraying and stepping on the newly redesigned naira notes at a party surfaced online. This was as operatives of the Lagos zonal command of the EFCC commenced an investigation into the matter, noting that it was an offence contrary to Section 21 of the Central Bank of Nigeria Act, 2007. EFCC operatives also seized a Range Rover and iPhone belonging to the actress, as items recovered from her. Section 21 (1) of the CBN Act reads that “A person who tampers with a coin or note issued by the Bank is guilty of an offence and shall on conviction be liable to imprisonment for a term not less than six months or to a fine not less than N50,000 or to both such fine and imprisonment.”
