Senator Ibrahim Shekarau has been declared winner of the 2023 Kano Central Senatorial District election under the New Nigerian Peoples Party. Shekarau, a sitting senator was in the NNPP and was nominated to vie for the senatorial position under its platform. However, before the elections, he announced his defection from the NNPP and abandoned his senatorial ambition to join the Peoples Democratic Party. But the Independent National Electoral Commission later insisted that it still recognised him as the legitimate NNPP candidate, even though the party replaced him with another candidate, Rufaâ€™i Sani Hanga. Shekarau, who is going to the red chamber for the second time was declared by the returning officer of the senatorial district, Professor Tijjani Darma. According to INEC, Shekarau polled 456,787 votes to defeat the All Progressives Congress candidate, Alhaji Abdulkarim Zaura, who polled 168,677 votes.
