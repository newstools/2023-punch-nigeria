The Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, has advised the next administration to study the regime of the President, Muhammadu Buhari, and learn from it. The SGF noted that the current regime had learnt lessons that would be useful for the incoming administration. Mustapha made the observation when he inaugurated the presidential transition council in Abuja on Tuesday. The transition committe has the mandate to facilitate seamless handover of power from the Buhari regime to a new one. The council, among other things, will also facilitate the handing over process by the current President to the President-elect; organise for the security of the President-elect and the Vice President-elect including coordinating security briefings on the nation’s security matters post- elections. Mustapha said, “In a few months, it will be eight years that the Buhari administration has been in power. Within this period, we have made significant strides in advancing the fortunes of our nation, we have also learnt lessons that will be useful for the incoming administration and it is on the strength of this trajectory that the current administration is committing itself to making the 2023 transition process seamless for the incoming President and his team. “Our achievements must be preserved. The reforms that enabled those achievements must therefore, be documented and communicated in clear terms, so the incoming administration understands what we have done, the basis of our decisions, what we achieved and the opportunities for continuity.”
