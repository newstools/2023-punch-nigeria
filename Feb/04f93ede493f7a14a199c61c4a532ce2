 No fewer than two people were injured on Thursday in an attack on the convoy of the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party for the House of Representatives, Lagos Mainland Constituency, Segun Gbayi. The attack by the yet-to-be-identified gunmen happened in the Makoko area, Yaba, Lagos. The gunmen also attacked the security escorts attached to the convoy, opened fire and vandalised their vehicles. However, Gbayi escaped the attack unhurt. Reacting, Gbayi said the attack was to prevent members and supporters of the party from exercising their franchise in tomorrow’s election. “This attack was violently carried out to discourage us from exercising our political franchise,” he said. He advised voters and the general public to remain safe during this period and report any case of threat to lives, vandalisation, or violent attack to security officers.
