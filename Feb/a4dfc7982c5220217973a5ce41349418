He said MAN is concerned and committed to upholding a conducive environment where manufacturing business can grow and establish economic opportunities for the unemployed youths in the country.

If funds are released, it should be monitored effectively.” He disclosed MAN had interactions with the presidential candidates on issues bothering it. “We have engaged the presidential aspirants on the importance of having a virile and competitive manufacturing sector. “We have equally pushed at different fora with major political contenders to incorporate the need to accelerate the growth and development of the manufacturing sector in their economic agenda.” “In this regard, we have availed all the political parties with our Blueprint for the Accelerated Development of Manufacturing in Nigeria as well as the agenda for manufacturing in Nigeria for the next 10 years,” he said In his reaction to the 10-day extension for the naira swap, he said the judiciary already pronounced judgement, which no other can reverse.
