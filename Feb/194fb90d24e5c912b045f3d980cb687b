…says Omotosho already expelled The Ondo State Chapter of the Labour Party has reacted to the purported defection of some of its members and supporters to the All Progressives Congress at a ceremony held in Adegbemile Hall in Akure, the state capital. A statement by the Ondo State Chairman of the Labour Party,  Mrs Remilekun Ojo, said the event was attended by “a few dozen people” who claimed to be the South-West chapter of the party. The said former LP members on Monday announced they were “collapsing” the Labour Party in the region into the APC, saying the party could not win elections. “As expected, the meeting was chaired by an expelled member [of the LP], Banji Omotoso, who was the then Caretaker State Chairman in Ekiti State from 2017 to 2019,” Ojo said. The statement stressed that the LP in the South-West and in the six geopolitical regions “remains one and indivisible.” Under no circumstances will the party think of merging with any party, “not even the APC that has brought untold hardship and suffering to the nation,” she added. The statement said Omotoso, the so-called “Southwest coordinator,” was sacked for “gross malfeasance and anti-party activities” in January 2020 and ceased to have anything to do with the party and therefore had no authority to speak for or on behalf of the LP.
