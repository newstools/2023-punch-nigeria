He was tried by E.O. Owumi and has been sentenced to one-year imprisonment with hard labour to start from the date of remand in custody.

He further called on members of the public to report suspicious activity around its infrastructure to the nearest EKEDC office or any of the company’s official complaint channels: Website: https://ekedp.com, Email: whistleblower@ekedp.com.
