The Sokoto State Police Command has confirmed the arrest of 10 suspected political thugs terrorising various areas in the state. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Sanusi Abubakar, who confirmed the development in a statement on Tuesday, said weapons, charms and drugs were recovered from the suspects. Abubakar said the development complied with the directives of the state Commissioner of Police, Mohammed Gumel, to Area Commanders and DPOs, to embark on raids on areas prone to harbouring thugs, especially at campaign offices, party offices and residents of some politicians, and to ensure no space for thugs to operate in the state. The statement said, “The police in collaboration with members of Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security has escalated top crime prevention actions and so far arrested a syndicate of 10 political thugs with dangerous weapons, assorted charms and drugs at various locations in the state. “As a result of the recent stop and search operations conducted by police immediately after the public announcement issued by the command, the first syndicate of the thugs was arrested at Kangiwa square while others were arrested at Hubbare Area. As at the time of filing this report, all the suspects have been arraigned in court and are committed to remand in a correctional facility in Sokoto.” Noting that the exercise was a continuous activity, Abubakar said Gumel had directed all the DPOs to search the premises of all campaign offices, party offices and identified residences of politicians with the habit of breeding thugs in the state.
