There was tight security presence around the vicinity of the secretariat of the All Progressives Congress, venue of Sundayâ€™s political roundtable of the governors, and the leadership of the party. Several routes leading to the popular Balantyre Street in Wuse II were on Sunday barricaded by stern-looking security operatives. The development is coming barely 48 hours after the National Chairman of the APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, summoned the state governors to an emergency meeting on Sunday. In attendance at the meeting were the members of the National Working Committee of the party, Governors Nasir El-Rufai (Kaduna), Abdullahi Sule (Nasarawa), Muhammad Inuwa Yahaya (Gombe), Mai Mala Buni (Yobe), Abubakar Badaru (Jigawa) and Abubakar Sani Bello (Niger), Yahaya Bello (Kogi), Simon Lalong (Plateau), Biodun Oyebanji (Ekiti) and Sani Bello (Niger). The absence of Governors Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano), Atiku Bagudu (Kebbi), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos) and virtually all his counterpart in the South were felt. Governors of Imo and Katsina states, however, had some representatives in attendance.
