Tropical General Investments Group says it has entered into a collaborative arrangement with the Union Bank of Nigeria Plc through its company, WACOT Rice Limited to open bank accounts for about 7,000 farmers operating in rural areas of Kebbi State. A statement by the company said the move was geared towards driving financial inclusion and including the beneficiaries in Nigeria’s evolving digital economy. TGI’s Group Director of Corporate Affairs, Sadiq Kassim, stated this in Abuja recently during a panel discussion at the just concluded seminar on digital economy organised by the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture. The seminar was themed “Promoting a vibrant economy as a catalyst for economic growth in Nigeria.” According to him, one of the critical philosophies of the TGI Group is to operate within communities as a partner for growth and development. “On the documentation leg, we worked with Union Bank and partnered with the Ministry of Digital Economy to set up the NIN registration in designated centres in their communities. We also partnered with various local governments to assist with government-issued ID cards. With all these in place in the designated centres, within a few weeks, they were able to capture and open bank accounts for the farmers who are now a part of the digital economy.”
