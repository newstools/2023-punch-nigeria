The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, has said he will reduce the cost of governance if elected in the upcoming presidential election scheduled for February 23. He disclosed this via his official Twitter handle on Monday as part of his address to the Nigerian Economic Summit Group. He tweeted, “We will work with the CBN to reduce the ‘ways and means’ to what is allowable under the law and for a more transparent and liberalized foreign exchange market,” While promising a robust program implementation which will be utilised and supervised by the office of the President, he said will also engage Nigeria’s creditors for debt restructuring and possible cancellation. “We will strive towards a zero-based national budget to overcome the mindset and reality of past non-performing national budgets routinely hampered by budgetary deficit overhangs,” he said. “In addition to the above, all security agencies, EFCC and ICPC will be strengthened to support our determination to fight and significantly reduce corruption,” he said.
