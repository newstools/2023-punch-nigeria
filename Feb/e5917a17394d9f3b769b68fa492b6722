A former Special Assistant to the President in the Office of the First Lady, Zainab Kassim has filed a suit for the enforcement of her fundamental rights against the Presidentâ€™s wife, Aisha Buhari, while demanding N100m as damages from her and other respondents. The other respondents in the case are the Inspector-General of Police and the Department of State Services.
