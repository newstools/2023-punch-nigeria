The Peoples Democratic Party has said that Nigerians will not vote for the All Progressives Congress and its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, considering their “level of corruption, incompetence, insensitivity, lack of leadership and arrogance in failure”. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday at the party headquarters in Abuja, National Publicity Secretary of the party, Debo Ologunagba, said voting for APC and Tinubu was an “endorsement of corruption”. “It is therefore clear that any vote for the APC and its Presidential Candidate is an endorsement of corruption, incompetence, insensitivity, lack of leadership and arrogance in failure. “In contrast however, the All Progressives Congress and its embattled presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, in their vacuity, arrogance and entitlement mentality treated Nigerians with unpardonable disdain by refusing to engage the people in interactive sessions, debates and media interviews,” he said. Ologunagba said Atiku had continued to demonstrate that he remains a Pan-Nigeria leader with the required experience, capacity, integrity, stamina, presence of mind, commitment, sense of duty and readiness to lead our nation at this critical time. “Through the course of the campaign, Atiku Abubakar and his running mate, Ifeanyi Okowa energetically traversed the nooks and crannies of our country, engaging various segments of Nigerians in diverse fora; consultative meetings, interactive sessions, town hall meetings, faith-based platforms, media interviews and political rallies articulating their plans, solutions and selling the message of hope to Nigerians. “While Atiku Abubakar continues to engage Nigerians on issues that are critical to our nation; including national unity and stability, security, restructuring, infrastructural development, empowerment of the people through diversification, Asiwaju Tinubu abdicated because he has no solution to the myriads of problems brought upon our nation by the APC which he admitted to have brought into the office. “Since his emergence as the presidential candidate of the APC, Asiwaju Tinubu and the APC have not been able to engage in a campaign on issues rather their focus have been on individuals and irrelevances, even display of unseriousness and comics,” he said.
