Youssef En-Nesyri and Bryan Gil helped Sevilla to a 2-0 win over Real Mallorca on Saturday in La Liga to record a fourth consecutive home victory. Jorge Sampaoli’s side rose provisionally to 12th, four points clear of the relegation zone, bouncing back strongly after their thrashing by Barcelona last Sunday. Mallorca, who beat champions Real Madrid the same day, were far tamer at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan. Morocco striker En-Nesyri sent the hosts ahead with a simple finish after running on to a long ball, with Mallorca’s defence asleep. It was his third goal in three league games, having failed to score in his first 14 top flight appearances this season. Gil, on loan back at his former side from Tottenham, doubled the lead from point blank range after 40 minutes when Jesus Navas’s cross slid all the way through to him. Sevilla could not extend their lead after the break but the fans were content with the victory which continued their revival after a terrible start to the season. Earlier Real Betis moved provisionally fifth with an entertaining 3-2 win at Almeria, ending their own poor run of one win in six games across all competitions. Sergio Canales was the visitors’ key player, scoring and setting up the winner for veteran Mexican midfielder Andres Guardado. Later Saturday struggling Valencia host Athletic Bilbao, while league leaders Barcelona visit Villarreal Sunday among other games. AFP
