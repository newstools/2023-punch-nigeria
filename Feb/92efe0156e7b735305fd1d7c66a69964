 Political supporters of Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, attacked the Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, by throwing stones and other objects at him. This happened in an event organised to honour the verdict of the Supreme Court, declaring Lawan the valid senatorial candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress for Yobe North in the National Assembly election. Trouble began when the governor stood up to deliver his speech. As Buni began his speech, the angry loyalties began to chant slogans of rejection, ‘bwamayi bwamayi bwamaso,” which implies we don’t want you”. It was gathered that Buni was booed because he backed Lawan’s opponent, Bashir Machina, who was the APC candidate until the Supreme Court’s ruling. The hecklers subsequently started throwing objects at the governor and other guests at the podium, forcing the rally to a sudden end while the governor was whisked away by security operatives. The event, which doubled as the APC’s zonal campaign rally for the Yobe North district, had hundreds of loyalties of the party present. The supporters had earlier praised and welcome Lawan who spoke before the governor.
