The Federal Capital Territory Police Command has said it is investigating a video making the rounds on social media alleging that its operatives arrested suspected manipulators of the Bimodal Voters Accreditation System in Abuja on Tuesday. The PUNCH reports that a video had been trending online, alleging that some suspects were arrested by the police in a residential building at No. 15, Ganges Street, Maitama, FCT. The video caption alleged that their arrest followed a tip off from unidentified sources that the location was being used as a base to manipulate last Saturday’s elections. It also claimed that the police recovered numerous BVAS machines and several laptops and desktop computers, as well as other materials from the suspects. However, the FCT Police Public Relations Officer, SP Josephine Adeh, in a telephone interview with our correspondent on Tuesday night, said the Command was investigating the authenticity of the video. Adeh said, “We don’t understand why some media platforms have been publishing the story without confirming its authenticity from the police. “We can’t ascertain the identity of those seen in the video, and they do not look like our officers because our officers have been operating on camouflage uniform since the elections began. “Anyone could have been in that video. However, we’re investigating the video to ascertain its authenticity, and we’ll inform the general public on our findings in due time.”
