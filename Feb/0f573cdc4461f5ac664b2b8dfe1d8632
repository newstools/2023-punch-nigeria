The Peoples Democratic Party and All Progressives Congress in Osun State on Friday traded words over alleged plans to buy votes with foodstuffs. There were insinuations that the parties decided to give out food items in exchange for votes because they could not get enough cash to give voters. It was also learnt that some political parties had collected account details of voters and started paying into them ahead of the poll. A voter in Ward 4, Olorunda Local Government Area, Osogbo, Osun State, who preferred to be identified simply as Azeez, said his account details had been collected by a party but he had yet to be credited. However, sources close to the parties said lack of cash had forced them to consider other alternatives that could involve giving out food items to voters. In an interview with our correspondent, PDP’s director of media in the state, Oladele Olabamiji, said his party was not involved in such acts. He said, “APC should be properly monitored as it could choose to buy votes with food items. But for us in PDP, we are loved and people know that we are for them and they will be willing to support us without inducement.” Also, the spokesperson for the APC in the state, Mr Kola Olabisi, dismissed the allegation. “It is the figment of the imagination of those spreading such. PDP is afraid of defeat and they will look for excuse why they fail. It should be discarded,” he added.
