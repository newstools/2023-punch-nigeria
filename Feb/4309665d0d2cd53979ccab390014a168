The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, on Monday said, it had about 1.8 billion litres of Premium Motor Spirit, popularly called petrol, that would be enough from mid-February to March 2023. It said this was part of concerted efforts put in place to sustain the supply of petroleum products across the country, in order to forestall the re-emergence of queues in Nigeria. The PUNCH had reported on Monday that fuel queues might return to filling stations soon if NNPCL failed to ramp up importation and beef up petrol supplies across the country. Oil marketers had told our correspondent in Lagos that NNPCL depots that feed private depots across the country ran out of supplies over the weekend following the mopping up of available supplies by oil marketers. “Although we have started loading, the product is yet to go round. Besides, NNPCL depots ran out of supplies over the weekend, but we are hoping products will be available this week so that we will resume loading,” one of the marketers had stated on Sunday.
