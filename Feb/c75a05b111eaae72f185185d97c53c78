After eight days in captivity, kidnappers of the Cross River State Commissioner of Women Affairs, Prof Gertrude Njar, have demanded N150 million for her release. This is according to an update shared by the publisher of Cross Rivers Watch, Agba Jalingo, on his official Facebook page. The commissioner was abducted within the Mayne Avenue-Atamunu area of Calabar South in the early hours of February 1. The PUNCH reports that the Cross River State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Eric Anderson, while announcing the unfortunate incident to journalists, said the police and the Permanent Secretary, Special Duties, Dr Alfred Mboto, had been contacted. He also expressed worry that “such an ugly development could take place in the heart of the town.” Njar alongside other commissioners was sworn in by Governor Ben Ayade recently.
