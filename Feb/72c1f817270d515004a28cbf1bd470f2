The Nigeria Police Force, on Thursday in Abuja, said it will use minimal force to address possible violence that may trail the announcement of results. The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, said this while fielding questions from our correspondent at the 66th session of the State House Briefing organised by the Presidential Communications Team at the Aso Rock Villa, Abuja. According to the police chief, the force’s election plan extends long after the announcement of results. Therefore, he said, adequate plans are on the ground to identify, isolate and arrest individuals and groups engaged in post-election violence. Earlier, the IGP revealed that he would deploy 310,973 of its personnel ahead of the elections. They will be drawn from conventional policemen and women, mobile police, special forces, intelligence response team and the counter-terrorism unit, amongst others. However, the force’s efforts will be augmented by 93,495 additional personnel comprising the National Security and Civil Defence Corps, the Nigeria Correctional Service, National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, he said. In terms of mobile infrastructure, Baba also revealed that at least 74 Armoured Personnel Carriers, 37 Water Cannons, 1,240 patrol vehicles, 50 ambulances and 300 motorcycles will be deployed nationwide. This also includes surveillance helicopters, canine support, amongst others. The IGP said the force will “police against elements who will try to disrupt the smooth conduct of the electoral exercise and police peace-loving citizens to enable them come out and vote”.
