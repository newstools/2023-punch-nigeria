The Federal Government has commenced the registration of importers of electrical electronic equipment across the country in a bid to regulate their activities and curb e-waste. It said the National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency had developed a Guide for Importers of Used Electrical Electronic Equipment to adequately manage e-waste in Nigeria. NESREA, an agency of the Federal Government, disclosed this in a statement issued in Abuja on Friday, to announce the inauguration of an Inter-Agency Committee by its Director-General, Prof. Aliyu Jauro. The inter-agency committee, made up of officials of NESREA and the National Broadcasting Commission, was set up to strengthen the collaboration between the two agencies in the management of e-waste. NESREA said the committee would particularly ensure an e-waste free environment at the end of the digital switch-over in Nigeria. According to the statement, Jauro, who was represented at the event by the Director, Inspection and Enforcement, Abdulsalaam Isa, pointed out that the hazardous content inherent in e-waste posed a threat to human health and the environment. The statement read in part, “He (Jauro) said NESREA has taken necessary steps to rid the country of e-waste by developing and operationalising the National Environmental (Electrical and Electronic Sector) Regulations 2022, which has been revised and ready for gazette. “NESREA has also developed the Guide for Importers of Used Electrical Electronic Equipment and the registration of importers of electrical electronic equipment to regulate their activities.”
