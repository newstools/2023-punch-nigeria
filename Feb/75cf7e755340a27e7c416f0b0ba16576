The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria has appealed to the Federal Government for more time to sell Premium Motor Spirits at the official price of N195 per litre. The  Vice Chairman of IPMAN, Western Zone, Joseph Akanni, made the request on Monday in Ibadan. In an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria, he disclosed that all chairmen of the association will subsequently be holding a meeting in Abuja. “We have pleaded with the authority to give us time to sell off the products, this is against the backdrop that our members want to go on rampage,” he said. Akanni said the association has also instructed its members not to buy petroleum products at high costs they can’t sell at the official pump price. “We have also advised our members not to buy any products that they can’t sell at N195 litre according to the Federal Government guideline,” Akanni added.
