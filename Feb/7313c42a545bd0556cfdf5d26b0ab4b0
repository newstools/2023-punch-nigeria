Sterling Bank says it has waived all personal account transaction fees as part of its gesture of solidarity for its customers over the new naira scarcity challenge. The Chief Executive Officer, Sterling Bank, Abubakar Suleiman, made the announcement in an email to customers. The message in the mail to Sterling’s customers read in part, “We at Sterling recognise the difficult circumstances many of our customers are going through. In light of this, from February 6, 2023, through February 18, 2023, our fund transfer services will be provided free of charge to all personal account customers. “In addition, we are glad to inform you that we will provide free debit cards to all interested customers. This will provide you with a convenient and secure way to make purchases and carry out transactions.” A statement said this is part of Sterling Bank’s continued efforts to support its customers and the general public as Nigeria adjusts to the availability of the new naira notes that are now being distributed across the country. Sterling Bank’s Chief Marketing Officer, Dante Martins, said, “We believe that by eliminating transaction costs for this period, we can assist our customers make their banking experience more easy by making the most of our powerful digital solutions. “We understand that our consumers need choices when it comes to their everyday requirements, and we want to make sure that we can serve them as best as we can during this time.”
