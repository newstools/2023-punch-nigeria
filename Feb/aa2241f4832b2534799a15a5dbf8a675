The Peoples Democratic Party, Labour Party and the African Action Congress have kicked against the call by Musiliu Akinsanya (MC Oluomo)-led Lagos State Parks Management Committee to convey sensitive election materials in the forthcoming governorship elections. It was reported that the LASPG, in a letter addressed to Independent National Electoral Commission in January, informed the commission that the National Union of Road Transport Workers had been banned by the Lagos State Government, and other states in the South-West. The group asked INEC to place the logistics of sensitive electoral materials in its purview. The letter read in part, “The Lagos State Parks and Garages Management hereby writes to bring to your notice that Lagos State and states such as Oyo, Ogun, Ondo, Osun and some states are no longer under the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) as far as transportation is concerned, but under the various States Parks and Garages respectively. “Our notification and request letter become imperative in order for there not to be technical as well as an administrative lacuna in terms of transporting logistics and deployment/retrieval of election materials and personnel to and from all election points in the aforementioned States during the forthcoming 2023 general election, which if not quickly addressed, may affect the election day. “We at Lagos State Parks and Garages, under the Chairmanship of Alhaji (Dr.) Musiliu Ayinde Akinsanya do hereby request that INEC should conduct an investigation into this information supplied while at the same time requesting that all transportation-related arrangements in Lagos State should be at our preview because the operation of NURTW in Lagos State has been suspended.” However, several attempts to reach the spokesperson of INEC, Adenike Oriowo, and the Resident Electoral Commissioner of the state, Olusegun Agbaje, proved abortive. Reacting to the letter by the LASPG, the State Secretary of the LP, Chief Sam Okpala, said the party was not comfortable with the engagement of LASPG because of the ‘obvious loyalty’ that Akinsanya (MC-Oluomo) has for the presidential candidate of the All Progressive Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.
