The All Progressives Congress, Abia State chapter is in a last minute split over alleged suspension of the senator representing Abia North by his Igbere Ward. In a letter allegedly signed by the Chairman of the Disciplinary Committee, Paul Nwabuisi, state Secretary, Chief Chidi Avajah and the state Chairman, Dr Kingsley Ononogbu, the party said, “You are hereby suspended from the All Progressives Congress.” However, the same leadership has through its spokesperson dismissed the reports that it had suspended its Abia North senatorial candidate and Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr Orji Uzor Kalu. Denying the reported suspension, the party spokesperson, Okey Ezeala, described the reports as the handiwork of the Peoples Democratic Party. According to a terse statement signed by Ezeala, the party distanced itself from the report stating that there is no iota of truth in it. Ezeala said that the malicious write-up was occasioned by the PDP’s fright to accept tomorrow’s imminent defeat. According to the party, Orji Kalu remains the candidate of the party as both the APC and his constituents are satisfied with his performance. On the allegation of anti-party activities and other offences, the party described the accusations as false, stating that Orji Kalu had always remained a committed member of the party and its progress.
