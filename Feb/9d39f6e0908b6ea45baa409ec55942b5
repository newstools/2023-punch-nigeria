The House of Representatives candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in Akoko South-East and South-West Federal Constituency in Ondo State, Gbenga Kolawole, on Monday, rejected the outcome of last Saturday election in the federal constituency. The Independent National Electoral Commission had declared Mr Adegboyega Adefarati of the All Progressives Congress as winner of the election. In the result declared, the APC candidate polled 25,874 while the PDP candidate scored 18,403 and SDP polled 4,560. In a statement issues by the Spokesperson of the PDP Campaign Council for the federal constituency, Mr Tayo Omololu, said the declaration was made in contempt of judgment of the Federal High Court delivered on February, 17, 2023. According to him,  the court had declared that the APC had no candidate in Akoko South-East/South-West Federal Constituency, barring the APC and its candidate from participating in the general elections. The statement said, “The same said court also barred the Independent National Electoral Commission from having anything whatsoever to do with APC in the house of representatives election.” The party urged the INEC to declare and return  Kolawole as “the winner of the election being the candidate that scored the highest number of lawful votes and not the APC candidate, who going by the Federal High Court judgement was not a candidate in the election.” The party also urged its supporters to remain calm and be law abiding citizens, saying Kolawole will recover and reclaim his mandate in due course.
