The Cross River State governorship candidate of the Peoples Redemption Party, Usani Usani, Thursday, escaped a snake attack at his country home in the Mkpani community of Yakurr Local Government Area. Usani was earlier reported to have escaped an assassination attempt on the Calabar-Ikom Federal Highway on his way to his hometown but two others were shot dead in the deadly encounter. The spokesperson of the former minister of Niger Delta Affairs, David Agabi, confirmed to The PUNCH that it was true. Agabi through a text message said his boss (Usani) was attacked while he was taking a walk around his country home at noon. Although he berated a social media post that he was bitten by the snake, adding, “he almost stepped on the snake but it was killed after it was sighted. “This is one too many.” Agabi added, “People are on a mission to take Usani’s life, after a failed assassination attempt; now they sent a snake?”
