The Peoples Democratic Party has described as evil, the allegations that some individuals at the Presidency were plotting to install an interim government at the expiration of the tenure of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). There have been allegations that some powerful elements in high places were responsible for the current fuel and naira scarcity in the country in their bid to cause the postponement of the February 25 presidential election and prepare the ground for the enthronement of an interim government. But speaking with our correspondent on Saturday, the National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Debo Ologunagba, said the very thought of an interim government was unacceptable to millions of Nigerians. He said, “As a party, we don’t want to be drawn into the controversy of who is plotting what, when and how. But whether those plotting an interim government for our country are in Aso Rock or the forest, we want to advise them to perish the thought. “Interim government is evil and unacceptable to Nigerians.  Nigerians are ready for the election. The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) has also expressed his readiness for the election and so are the Independent National Electoral Commission and the security agencies. “We have held several press conferences where we drew the attention of Nigerians to this plot. Today, it is out in public discourse. We must rise and charge the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) to live by his pledge to bequeath a legacy of credible election to Nigerians.” Ologunagba said the PDP would leave the All Progressives Congress to Nigerians to judge amid the fuel crisis and naira scarcity in the country. Efforts to get the position of the APC, New Nigeria Peoples Party and the Labour Party were unsuccessful as their spokespersons, Felix Morka, Major Agbor and Yunusa Tanko, respectively, did not pick up their calls or respond to messages sent to them at the time of filing this report.
