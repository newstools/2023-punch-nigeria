The Kwara State Governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, has called on members of the All Progressives Congress to sustain the momentum and canvass for votes from all eligible voters in the state to guarantee the success of the party in Saturday’s governorship and House of Assembly elections. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Rafiu Ajakaye, the governor said, “We must not relent because of the success recorded in previous elections. We must redouble our efforts to consolidate on our success. We must continue to canvass and campaign for our party and all our candidates. We must all come out and vote next Saturday.” AbdulRazaq, who attended his ward meeting at Adewole Ward in Ilorin West Local Government Area on Saturday evening, was quoted to have said, “I want to call on all APC stakeholders, including elders, women, and youth groups, to continue the campaign to ensure the victory of the party.” The governor congratulated party faithful and all residents of the state for their support for the APC, which he said earned it a huge victory in the presidential and National Assembly elections. “We are glad that Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and all our other National Assembly candidates emerged victorious in the polls. We say Alhamdulilah (Thank God). And we thank the people of Kwara State for their support. In the coming elections next Saturday, our party will also emerge victorious, and we will say Alhamdulilah again,” he added.
