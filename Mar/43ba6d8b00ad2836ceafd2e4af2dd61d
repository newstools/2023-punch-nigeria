According to the president of the group, Eugene Okonta, “Having found him worthy to deliver, when elected, as the governor of Abia State, it might interest you to know, that the endorsement of Sir Mascot Uzor Kalu came after a careful studious process as our gubernatorial candidate for the Saturday, 11th March governorship election in the state. “We believe that he will deliver on the mandate of Abians if given the opportunity to serve.” The youths commended all Nigerians for coming out en masse and participating actively in the just concluded presidential/National Assembly Elections, stating, “Though, the said elections was marred by a lot of irregularities ranging from falsification and altering of figures, intimidation of voters to disenfranchisement which was as a result of late arrival of materials to respective polling units.” He called on the electorates “not to feel dejected, downcast and hopeless, because they feel that your votes didn’t count. “At this stage, let us remember that the power still lies in the hands of the people, hence, we are urging the youths especially, to add more zeal in order to avoid a repetition of what happened in some parts of the country during the presidential/National Assembly Elections. “We are appealing to INEC to maintain a neutral and an impartial stand during the conduct of the forthcoming gubernatorial/Houses of Assembly elections, which will be holding on the 11th of March, across the country
