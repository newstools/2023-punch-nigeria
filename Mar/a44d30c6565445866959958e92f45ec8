The Labour Party in Lagos State says it is not considering a political alliance with the Peoples Democratic Party for the forthcoming governorship election in the state. The party made this known to The PUNCH through its spokesperson, Olubunmi Odesanya, in an exclusive interview on Tuesday. Earlier, a leading Labour Party supporter in the state and Afenifere leader, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, had told The PUNCH the party would consider available options to defeat the ruling All Progressive Congress in the March 11 governorship elections in the state. He had simply told The PUNCH, “We shall consider all the options before us.” However, Odesanya said Labour Party would not consider joining forces with the PDP for the elections. “Labour Party is not considering any alliance with PDP,” Odesanya said in a phone interview with our correspondent. Recall that the LP presidential candidate, Peter Obi, floored the presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, who is also a former governor of Lagos State.
