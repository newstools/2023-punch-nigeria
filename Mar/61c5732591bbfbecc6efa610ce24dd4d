The 774 local government areas in Nigeria are allocated revenues from the federation account monthly. Revenue from oil, relevant taxes, the Nigerian Customs Service trade facilitation activities, Company Income Tax, sale of national assets, and surplus and dividends from State Owned Enterprises are aggregated in the federation account for sharing amongst the three tiers of government. According to the current sharing formula, the Federal Government gets 48.5 per cent, state governments 26.72 per cent, and Local Government 20.6 per cent from the federation account. Recently, state governments and local governments asked the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission to increase their shares of the federal allocation. According to the National Deputy President of the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria, Shehu Jega, local governments need higher revenue allocations to be able to survive and avoid phasing into extinction. During a programme organised by RMAFC, he said, “ALGON wishes to tell the Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission that it has a great important role to play in rescuing local government system from extinction – extinction in the sense that local government system needs increase in the revenue sharing formula. “After that allocation, it has to be monitored to ensure that each local government council in the country gets its allocation straight to its account.” According to the President of the National Union of Local Government Employees, Mr Ambali Olatunji, local governments do not get most of the money disbursed to them because of state governments. In an earlier interview with The PUNCH, he said, “The money was allocated, but it wasn’t given to local governments. Twenty-five per cent of that money did not get to them. “These monies are being diverted and pilfered by state political actors relying on Section 162 of the constitution that says, ‘allocation of funds to the local government should be through joint accounts allocation committee and should be appropriated by Houses of Assembly’” According to an economist, and a faculty member at the Lagos Business School, Bongo Adi, local governments area are state governors piggybanks. He stated that the country needs to restore the rural economy, which is in the purview of the local governments, to the fore in order to have functional market systems, an effective economy, and people-serving policies. In an earlier interview with The PUNCH, he added, “We need to rethink the local government arrangement.”
