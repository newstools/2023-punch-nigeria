Former Manchester United striker Odion Ighalo has advised Napoli’s Victor Osimhen to join the Red Devils amid reports of interest from the Old Trafford fumbling giants, who are in dire need of a boost in attack. The 24-year-old’s impressive performance has attracted interests from top clubs in Europe, with United, Chelsea, PSG, Liverpool and Real Madrid all keen on signing the Nigerian. United manager Erik ten Hag has placed the Nigerian top of his transfer target for next summer. The Serie A top goal scorer has notched 19 goals and three assists in 21 league appearances for the Parthenopeans in the 2022/23 season. In a video chat with Sky Sports, Al Hilal striker Ighalo believes Osimhen’s style of football is a perfect match for United and urged him to sign for the Red Devils, noting that he would form a perfect partnership with Marcus Rashford. “I think it’s a good fit. Having Osimhen and Rashford will cause any defender panic,” Ighalo told Sky Sports. “If Osimhen asks me for my advice and what he should do, I’d advise him to go join Manchester United because it’s the biggest club. “I think he would fit into Manchester United so well.” The Serie A top goals scorer, who was in Rome on Monday to pick the award for the Foreign Athlete of The Year in Italy, recently spoke about his dream of playing in the Premier League, but would like to deliver the Scudetto for Napoli fans. “A lot of people worldwide consider the Premier League as the best and strongest league,” Osimhen said. “I’m in one of the best leagues in the world, which is the Italian Serie A. “Of course, I’m working so hard to make sure that I achieve my dream of playing in the Premier League someday, but it’s a process and I just want to keep on this momentum.”
