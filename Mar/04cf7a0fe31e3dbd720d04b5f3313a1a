Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State has appealed to state civil servants to vote for candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party in the forthcoming election to sustain the development agenda of the present administration. According to Ikpeazu, the state government under his watch had evolved several policies and programmes that would improve the welfare of workers. The governor said this on Thursday during a town hall meeting with the workers at the International Conference Centre, Umuahia, the state’s capital. He said, “On March 18, you must vote for continuity because, if you gamble with your future, you have also put your job on the line. “I owe it to you as a duty to remind you of the consequences of your indiscretion as you elect the next governor. “I have directed that between now and seven days that the leave allowance of civil servants be paid. “Even as I grant command promotion to everyone, its implementation will be easier, if you vote for the governorship candidate of PDP, Chief Okey Ahiwe.” According to him, Ahiwe will prioritise the welfare of workers, if elected. He urged them to vote candidates with good track record of stewardship and not to give their mandate to individuals that would put their future in jeopardy. The governor expressed gratitude to God for the cordial relationship that existed between the government and civil servants and commended them for their support while thanking them for playing a pivotal role in the infrastructure development recorded during his tenure. In a remark, Ahiwe, the PDP’s governorship aspirant, assured the people that the command promotion announced by the governor would be fully implemented by him, if voted into power. He promised to serve the state diligently and evolve programmes that would boost human capital development and increase productivity, NAN reported.
