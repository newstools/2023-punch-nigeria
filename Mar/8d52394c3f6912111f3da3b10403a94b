A chieftain of the Labour Party, Professor Pat Utomi, has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission to immediately commence the review of the election results in 12 states. The states include Lagos, Rivers, Delta, Imo, Akwa-Ibom, Plateau, Benue, Kaduna, Adamawa, Taraba, Bayelsa and Bauchi. Utomi, who made the call while addressing Journalists in Lagos on Friday, said the electoral umpire should set up a review committee that would comprise each member of the political parties. He said, “We ask for immediate review of the voting of last week in 12 states at the very least, including Lagos, Rivers, Delta, Imo, Akwa-Ibom, Plateau, Benue, Kaduna, Adamawa, Taraba, Bayelsa, Bauchi. “We ask that INEC immediately begins the process of review. It should collate and bring all the materials from all these states to Abuja where people will feel less threatened, and that every party name a number of well regarded people to be on the panel of review that will be open, transparent before the whole world and all the media. “Unless they do this, they have shown that they are not true democrats. It should be done immediately. It will enable INEC to come to some useful resolution. “Where there is a dispute about the outcome of the review, that all of us demand of the court system judgement based on a review of these troubled states and give the mandate to who the numbers point to.”
