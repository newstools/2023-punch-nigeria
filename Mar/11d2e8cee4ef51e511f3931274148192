A fully loaded truck, carrying baskets, on Friday crashed near New Tarzan Motors at the Upper Iweka Junction along the Onitsha-Owerri Road, Anambra State, spilling its contents. An eyewitness said the incident happened while the driver was struggling on the bad portion of the road. Although there was no loss of life, the incident caused gridlock as motorists and road users battled through the remaining portion of the road to continue their journey. Some of the eyewitnesses who spoke to our correspondent said the truck was heading towards the Main Market in Onitsha and coming from the Oba end of the expressway. “The driver of the truck was navigating through the bad portions of the road when he lost control. The overloaded items it was carrying also contributed to the fall of the vehicle as it loses balance easily. “There was no loss of life, as pedestrians and tricycle operators who were near the truck as of the time of the incident, had quickly escaped to safety before the truck finally fell,” a source said. “This section of the road is in bad shape as heavy duty vehicles always find it very difficult to navigate through. The topography is also poor, there is urgent need for relevant agencies to look into the situation. “Heavy-duty vehicles are always badly slanted each time they move at this place and that is why they fall at every slight mistake.” The eyewitnesses lamented that no relevant agencies came to control traffic as motorists and pedestrians battled the gridlock all through the night. As of the time of filing this report at about 9:52am on Saturday, the truck was still on the road with its spilled content without any rescue operation. See photos:
