Unstoppable Women of Web3, a Web3 educational group, has announced its commitment to providing Web3 and metaverse training to 6 million women in Africa over the next 5 years. It stated this in commemoration of International Women’s Day. According to a statement on Wednesday, the group is launching this initiative in collaboration with 19 companies. It stated, “As a first step towards the goal of onboarding 6 million women in Africa to Web3 and the metaverse, Unstoppable Women of Web3 and Unstoppable Domains will expand access to user-owned digital identity through free Unstoppable domains, which people can claim for the next 30 days.” The Founder, Unstoppable Women of Web3, Sandy Carter, said Africa had one of the most rapidly growing Web3 sectors, but it was not exempt from the gender equality issues witnessed across the globe. She said, “We need to make sure everyone has a seat at the table. “Empowerment starts with education, which is why we are thrilled to lead this initiative to educate 6 million African women on the metaverse and Web3.” Carter noted that in order to meet this commitment, the partner organisations will offer Web3 and metaverse education via a wide assortment of educational streams, programs, learning materials, in-person events, and online courses. She added, “Today, Africa is one of the fastest-growing adopters of blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and Web3 technology globally. “However, like many male-dominated tech and engineering sectors, Web3 suffers from uneven representation. “In 2021, for example, out of the 121 leading crypto companies, it was discovered that less than 5 per cent were founded by women, and women only represent 10 per cent of partners at crypto funds.”
