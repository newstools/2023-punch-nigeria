The Kaduna State Police Command has said that all culprits in connection with the renewed attack in Southern Kaduna will be decisively dealt with in accordance with the law. The command’s Public Relations Officer, DSP Muhammad Jalige, told newsmen in Kaduna, the state capital that it was true that gunmen attacked the southern part of the state in the early hours of Sunday. The police spokesman assured that security operatives were on top of the situation, noting that all the culprits involved would be rounded up. He said, “From the briefing, I received from the Area Commander, trouble started a couple of days ago when a boy rearing cattle was murdered. “We have been trying to manage the situation while investigating the sad occurrence before trouble broke out. “A joint security team will be combing the bushes in the area Sunday afternoon to search for bodies if there are any. They will also apprehend the suspects responsible for the killings. “We are on top of the situation and all the hoodlums responsible would be rounded up.” “But for the timely intervention of joint security personnel coordinated by the Area Commander, the terrorists would have had a field day. “Repelling  the hoodlums was a tedious task for our security agencies, but they were successful as the terrorists scampered away from the scene.”
