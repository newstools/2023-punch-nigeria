A pro-democracy body, the National Democratic Coalition Renewal Group, on Saturday condemned the opposition to the declaration by the Independent National Electoral Commission of the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, as the president-elect following his victory in the February 25 election. The National Leader, NADECO Renewal Group, Prof Atilade Adeeyo, who said “a Tinubu presidency is the best that has happened to Nigeria in recent time”, advised the opposition currently waging war against his victory to perish the thought of upturning it. Adeeyo stated this in a statement after a meeting of the group attended by its leaders across the geopolitical zones. The NADECO leader described Labour Party and Peoples Democratic Party’s war against Tinubu as “grossly undemocratic and amounting to exhibiting acts of bad losers in a free and fair contest”. It advised the LP presidential candidate, Peter Obi, and the PDP flag bearer, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, “to accept defeat honourably and congratulate the president-elect so that the nation can move on”. The group urged Nigerians across the board “to allow peace to reign so that we can enjoy the glorious ride to eldorado in this country as we would soon be driven by the president-elect, Tinubu”. Adeeyo said, “We can also assure our teeming youths that Tinubu will ensure that their yearning for a greater future is taken care of when he mounts the saddle of power. “We are standing up for our nation and Nigeria will work again. The families of those that died in the post-annulment of the 1993 elections will wish the annulment never happened. We cannot afford the foreseeable consequences of such calls. Nigeria must work in peace and tranquility.”
