Nigerian women judges have decried the persistent practice of female genital mutilation among ethnic communities in Nigeria. They expressed their concerns in a statement issued by the International Director, National Association of Women Judges of Nigeria, Justice Roli Harriman, on Thursday, in Maiduguri, to commemorate the International Day of Women Judges scheduled for Friday, March 10. They noted that the practice has constituted a matter of serious concern in the country. The women judges would not mention the communities known for such practices, nor quote figures on those practices they regarded as obnoxious in Nigeria. They, however, sought the provision of shelters for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, especially young girls, as well as the adoption laws and practice that guarantee justice and protection for such victims. The judges also expressed worries about the prevalence of domestic violence and the existence of what they describe as repugnant customary laws supporting such practices. The President of the association, Justice Jummai Sankey, appealed to concerned stakeholders and individuals to contribute towards their resolution. “We, therefore, call on all stakeholders including NGOs to assist in publicising these issues and offering their own contribution towards their resolution,” he said.
