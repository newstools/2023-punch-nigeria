Kwara State Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria, Rt Rev Sunday Adewole, on Saturday said the association had yet to adopt any candidate for the governorship election in the state. Adewole said the Kwara Province of the Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion) had also dissociated itself from the purported endorsement of a governorship candidate and a political party. Adewole, who is the Bishop of the Diocese of Kwara State Anglican Communion, said, “There is no division in Kwara CAN. We have not adopted any governorship candidate for Saturday’s election.”
