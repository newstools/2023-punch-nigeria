A founding member of the Arewa Consultative Forum, Alhaji Tanko Yakassai, has warned the president-elect, Bola Tinubu, not to bow to the pressure of forming a government of national unity. A national unity government or government of national unity is a broad coalition consisting of all parties (or all major parties), usually formed during a time of war or national emergency. The elder statesman gave the warning during an interview at his residence in Abuja on Wednesday. Tinubu polled 8,794,726 votes to defeat his closest rivals, Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party and Labour Party’s Peter Obi by 6,984,520 and 6,101,533 votes, respectively. Hours after the former Lagos State governor was announced as winner of the presidential election, political analysts have suggested that he adopt a unity government to douse the post-election tension and assuage frayed nerves. A former governor of Ekiti State and immediate past chairman of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum, Dr Kayode Fayemi, also drummed support for system of government on Wednesday. But Yakasai kicked against the recommendation, saying it is not good for the development of democracy in any given society. He said, “No, I won’t advise Tinubu to run any government of nationa unity. I want democracy to develop. Democracy is a business of competition. Repeal competition from democracy, you have killed democracy. Let everybody come with his own programme. “After all, the electorate voted for him. Let him put his programme into action. And where he concludes his own part, let the man coming after him build from where the previous man stopped. This is how you develop a country. And, in fact, this is how this house we are staying was built. They did the foundation, after then structure, vanishing of the house, painting and the rest of them. That is how you practise democracy. This is how it should also be done in nation building. It is what people all over the world are doing and this is what we should be doing.”
