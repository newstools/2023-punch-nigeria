Phrank Shaibu, a spokesperson for the presidential candidate of Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, has said that the presidential campaign council of the All Progressives Congress’ claim that there was rigging in the South-East during the presidential election was an evidence that indeed the election was marred with irregularities. The Independent National Electoral Commission had announced the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, as the winner of the election. Shaibu in a statement on Friday in Abuja said, “Festus Keyamo’s claim that there was massive rigging in the South-East and that the APC will be challenging the votes in that region validates our position that this election was fraught with irregularities. This is the reason we are seeking the cancellation of the results. We ask them to save their strength for the legal fireworks ahead. Nigerians and the world will see how APC stole the mandate of the people and most importantly, they should explain to Nigerians why people have been partying in Columbia while there is grave silence in Nigeria since the declaration of their candidate.”
