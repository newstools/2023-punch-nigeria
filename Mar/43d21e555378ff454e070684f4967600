  President-elect, Bola Tinubu, will be moving to the Defence Guest House in Maitama District of Abuja. He will function at the Defence Guest House until he is sworn-in as President on May 29, 2023. “The President-elect will be moving into Defence House, in Maitama, FCT, where he will spend the next couple of months, and from where he will move into the Presidential Villa,” a tweet by the All Progressives Congress Presidential Campaign Council read on Thursday. The notice came barely 24 hours after the Independent National Electoral Commission declared Tinubu as the winner of the February 25 presidential elections. From the Defence House, Mr Tinubu will receive briefings and hold key meetings as President-elect. Speaking with our correspondent on Thursday, the Spokesperson of the APC PCC, Festus Keyamo, said he could not confirm the actual time the President-elect will move into his new abode. However, this is not a new development as the current President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), also lodged at the same location months before his inauguration on May 29, 2015. Afterward, he moved into his official residence at the Aso Rock Villa, Abuja. The PUNCH reported that Tinubu who polled 8,794,726, led the Peoples Democratic Party’s Atiku Abubakar, who scored 6,984,520 votes, and Labour Party’s Peter Obi who polled 6,101,533. Rabiu Kwankwaso of the New Nigerian Peoples Party garnered 1,496,687 votes to emerge fourth.
