The National Emergency Management Agency has said that the communities affected by the recurring fire disaster will be assessed for consideration and support from the Federal Government. The Director General, Mustapha Habib Ahmed, stated this on Monday in a press statement by the agency on the recurrent fire disasters in Nigeria. He said NEMA noted with concern the recurrent fire incidents in the past few days, which affected some communities and markets. Ahmed said, “NEMA in the past few weeks had responded to some of the incidents by providing relief support to the affected persons. Furthermore, I have directed all NEMA Zonal and Operation Offices to work with the State Emergency Management Agencies to conduct joint assessments in communities affected by the disaster for consideration and support from the Federal Government.” While urging business owners, government agencies, and corporate organisations to leverage insurance to safeguard their properties, Ahmed called on all stakeholders to help prevent fire disasters in the country. He restated that it was everybody’s responsibility to save lives and safeguard property and called on all stakeholders and the media to help generate and disseminate the right awareness and prepare the public for necessary responses to fire disasters. He also advised that all efforts should be aimed at measures and procedures for averting fire incidents, and how to detect early and timely respond to such emergencies to save lives and minimise the damage and economic losses. “All hands must be on deck to reduce fire disasters and all associated human and material losses across Nigeria and beyond. “Government agencies, corporate organisations, private businesses, and individuals should endeavour to leverage insurance companies to safeguard and protect their properties and businesses as a form of risk transfer in case of fire and other unforeseen disasters,” he added.
