The Deputy Whip of the Senate, Sabi Abdullahi has congratulated the President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and his vice Kashim Shettima. In his congratulatory message, on Wednesday, Abdullahi extolled the qualities of Tinubu as a leader with distinct ability to take Nigeria on the next phase of its national journey. The lawmaker said, “I heartily congratulate Your Excellencies, President-elect of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and the Vice President-elect, Senator Kashim Shettima on your victory in the just concluded presidential election. “Your emergence speaks so much about the unwavering confidence reposed in you as leaders with the distinct ability to take Nigeria on the next phase of its national journey.” Abdullahi further stated that the outcome of the presidential poll “attests to your democratic credentials which suggest that under your watch, Nigerians need not worry about the independence of our institutions being compromised. They also need not worry about their freedoms and rights being suppressed.” The Niger North senator emphatically added, “Without a doubt, your goodwill has endeared Nigerians to embrace our great party the All Progressives Congress which insists on collective prosperity for all irrespective of ethnic or religious backgrounds. “It is my firm belief that your vision of “Renewed Hope” would consolidate and deliver on the policies of our great party already initiated by the administration of His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari.” He also commended the Independent National Electoral Commission for delivering free and fair elections, and remaining steadfast in spite of challenging moments that threatened to disrupt the peaceful conduct of the exercise. He added that the commission has, indeed, lived up to expectation in terms of improving Nigeria’s electoral process.
