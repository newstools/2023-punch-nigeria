  The Ogun State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has cautioned the electorate against vote buying ahead of the governorship and House of Assembly elections in the state. The party disclosed this in a statement issued in Abeokuta and signed by the Publicity Secretary, Tunde Oladunjoye, on Sunday. It warned the electorate to beware of people with ill-gotten wealth taunting and touting to buy people with money. “Beware of people taunting and touting to buy people with money. Our dear Ogun State is not for sale, no matter how they got their wealth or how much they are offering,” the statement read. Oladunjoye added that the party had made tremendous progress in all areas of the economy and attained unprecedented landmarks over the last three years. The APC urged the people of the state to vote massively for the party in Saturday’s elections. “Our immense gratitude to the people who voted massively for our party; it showed that our people are appreciative of good and exemplary governance by Prince Dapo Abiodun in the last three years and nine months. “The party remarked that the good people of Ogun state should make the next governorship and state House of Assembly elections the icing on the cake, having chosen Asiwaju Bola  Ahmed as President-elect, the only way to reap the fruits of our labour and benefits from the Bola Tinubu presidency, is to elect Prince Dapo Abiodun and all our candidates in the Saturday elections. “The APC government led by Prince Dapo Abiodun has provided housing estates for the masses more than all previous governments put together. We have paid and continue to pay the minimum wage for workers and other welfare programme,” the statement added. It added that the Ogun International Agro-Cargo Airport is not only a source of envy to other states but an affirmation that no height is too great for a creative, prudent and focused government to attain.
