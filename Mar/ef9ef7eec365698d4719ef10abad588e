The Nigeria Police Force has said it doesn’t envisage post-election violence in the country following the conclusion of the 2023 presidential and National Assembly elections held on Saturday. Saturday PUNCH reports that the announcement of the presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, by the Independent National Electoral Commission, as the president-elect, has been met with disagreement from some parties. The disagreement, however, was mainly from the supporters of the two major opposition parties, the Peoples Democratic Party and the Labour Party, whose presidential candidates, Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi, respectively came second and third in the presidential elections. Many of their supporters had taken to their social media handles to ask for the cancellation of the elections while demanding another election. Some had embarked on a protest while others vowed to ensure that their candidate’s mandate was recovered. However, the police noted that it was not aware of threats of protests or violence over the announced presidential election results. In an interview with our correspondent, the force spokesperson, Olumuyiwa Adejobi said, “We’re not aware of any post-election violence in Nigeria, and I don’t envisage any.” Prior to the elections, there were fears that violence might erupt after the election, especially from dissatisfied supporters of candidates who lost the election. The National Peace Committee had asked the candidates to sign a peace deal to demonstrate their commitment to peace.
