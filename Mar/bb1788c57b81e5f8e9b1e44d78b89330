The Osun State Governor, Ademola Adeleke, has assured that the recently upgraded University of Ilesa has come to stay. Adeleke stated this in Ilesa on Friday while addressing staff and students of the College of Education, Ilesa on the issues surrounding the university project. A statement by the governor’s spokesperson, Olawale Rasheed, said Adeleke, who had earlier gone round on an assessment tour of the University, also reiterated his administration’s commitment to ensuring proper take-off of the institution. The governor said the rush by the immediate past administration to upgrade the College of Education to a university was for political reasons. The statement further read, “I am here to access the actual state of the University of Ilesa and rub minds with our people on moving Ijesha forward. “The committee that I set up to review the process of the upgrade have submitted its report and my visit is the last stage of action before I will issue a white paper on the next line of action.” Commenting on the water project in Ilesa, Adeleke said, “The past APC government mismanaged the Ilesa water project with more than 12 billion naira spent so far without any result. “I have met with the Ministry of Water Resources who confirmed to me that the project failed due to fraudulent activities of the contractor. It is also public knowledge that the consultant for the water project allegedly made a demand of five million dollars from the state house committee on water resources. “We have since set up a Joint Committee with the Ministry of Water Resources. The contract will be re-advertised after an out-of-court settlement with all the stakeholders involved in the project.”
