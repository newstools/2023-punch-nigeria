Ahead the March 11, 2023 state House of Assembly and governorship elections across the country, the  All Progressives Congress in the South-West geopolitical zone  has appealed to the people to vote for the candidates of the ruling party. In the South-West, only Lagos, Ogun and Oyo States would have the governorship and the House of Assembly elections while Osun, Ondo and Ekiti states would only have only House of Assembly elections. The National Vice Chairman (South-West) of the APC, Mr Issac  Kekemeke, made the appeal in a statement issued on Monday and made available to our correspondent in Akure, the Ondo State capital. The APC leader who expressed appreciation to Nigerians from across all zones for supporting the President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, to clinch the presidential seat in the presidential election, urged the people of the South-West to extend the love they had shown the president-elect, to the party’s candidates in the March 11 governorship and assembly polls. According to the statement, Kekemeke said, “The people of the region would  fully benefit from the next administration of the President-elect, Bola Tinubu when they use their votes to install APC governors and state lawmakers in their respective states.” He also expressed confidence in the “ability and willingness of the president-elect to change the narration and reduce current hardship in the country as a result of naira scarcity.” He said, “We are calling on the Independent National Electoral Commission to create a level playing field for all candidates in the governorship and state House of Assembly elections, as it was done for candidates during the February 25 presidential election.” Kekemeke expressed optimism that the APC would also come out victorious in Saturday’s polls and charged members of the party to “sustain the momentum and canvass for votes from all eligible voters in the country to guarantee the success of the party in Saturday’s governorship and House of Assembly elections.”
