The Enugu Electricity Distribution Company Plc has said that the power outage currently being experienced in some parts of the South-East is a result of the industrial action by the organised labour union in Imo State. The organisation said the industrial action has led to the shutting down of its source of supply, leaving it with no energy to distribute. It stated these in a statement signed by the Head, Corporate Communications, EEDC, Emeka Ezeh, on Saturday. It added that the communities affected should ensure electricity infrastructures serving them are not attacked by vandals who might want to take advantage of the situation to attack and vandalise electricity equipment. The statement read, “The EEDC wishes to inform her esteemed customers that the loss of supply currently being experienced is a result of the industrial action by the organised labour union in Imo State. “This led to the shutting down of our source of supply, leaving us with no energy to distribute. “As a result, all our customers in Imo State are without electricity supply. “We understand the inconveniences this situation will cause our customers, and we are hopeful that the issue will be resolved within the shortest possible time so we can restore supply to our customers. “We, therefore, appeal to our customers to be vigilant and ensure the electricity infrastructures serving them are not attacked by vandals who might want to take advantage of the situation to attack and vandalise electricity facilities.”
