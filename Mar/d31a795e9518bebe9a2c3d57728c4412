Mr Kelvin Chukwu, younger brother of the late Oyibo Chukwu, has emerged as the Labour Party candidate for the Enugu East Senatorial Zone election slated for March 11. Oyibo was assassinated on February 22, 72 hours before the presidential and National Assembly elections along Amaechi-Agbani Road within the Enugu metropolis at about 7:20 p.m. while he was returning from a campaign. Chukwu emerged as the LP senatorial candidate during a by-election primary held on Sunday in Enugu with 223 votes to defeat three other rivals. Those who contested the ticket with him are Mr Uchenna Ogbodo, Mr Chinedu Nneji and Sir Chinyeaka Ohaa. Announcing the primary election results in the presence of two Independent National Electoral Commission observers on Sunday in Enugu, the LP National Vice Chairman (South-East), Innocent Okeke, said that Chukwu scored 223 votes and his rivals did not score any vote. Okeke, therefore, declared Chukwu the new flag bearer of the party for the Enugu East senatorial zone scheduled for March 11. Earlier, the LP state Chairman, Casmir Agbo, praised the 231 delegates drawn from the 77 wards in the senatorial district for their resilience and support. Responding, Chukwu promised to fulfill all the dreams of his late brother and make the people of the district proud. He added that the family was yet to recover from how his elder brother was gruesomely shot and burnt alongside his personal aide.
