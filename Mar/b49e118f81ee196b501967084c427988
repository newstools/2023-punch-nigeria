The leader of the pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, Pa Reuben Fasoranti, has congratulated the President-Elect, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, on his victory in the just concluded presidential election. Fasoranti advised Tinubu to avoid the mistakes made by his predecessors by ensuring that every ethnic group was united in his administration. This was contained in a congratulatory letter addressed to the president-elect by the nonagenarian. The letter read in part, “I did marvel at your doggedness, self-determination, self-assuredness, strong belief in self, ability to overcome daunting and ever-surging challenges. “I am, indeed, glad to know that your hard-earned victory had a very good national spread.” Fasoranti called on all Nigerians and the international community, who might be aggrieved, not to do anything that could set the country on fire but take legal means to seek redress.
