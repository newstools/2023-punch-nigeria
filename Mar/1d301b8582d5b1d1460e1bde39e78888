The Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria, Gombe State Chapter, Rev Fr Joseph Shinga, on Friday denied urging Christians in Gombe State not to vote for the candidate of the All Progressives Congress and state governor, Muhammadu Yahaya, in the March 11 governorship election. The Shinga had in the purported letter allegedly accused Yahaya of being a religious bigot with unfair policies affecting the Christian faith in the state. But the priest said the claims are unfounded, urging anyone with grouse against the governor to formally make it known through appropriate channels. “I stand to debunk the letter. He is not saying the mind of Christians the fact that he is anonymous means he is hiding and unsure of what he is saying, what he is saying is baseless or else he would have made himself known. “If he is a Christian that has a problem with the governor, he should come to us. We know how to contact the governor on any issue. We have a legal way of presenting bad feelings. We condemn it in entirety, we call on those spreading the fake news to desist from it.”
