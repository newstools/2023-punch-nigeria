The Nigerian Society of Engineers has urged the Federal Government to patronise local engineers in accordance with Executive Order 5. This was as it called for the full implementation of the order designed to promote the application of local content in technological innovation and allow local engineers access to procurement opportunities in contracts. The president of the society, Tasiu Gidari-Wudil, made the call during a press conference held on Saturday in commemoration of World Engineering Day. It will be recalled that on February 2, 2018, the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd ), signed Executive Order 5 for the planning and execution of projects, promotion of Nigerian content in contracts and science, engineering and technology. But speaking to journalists, Wudil expressed disappointment about the ineffectiveness of the order to reduce the number of expatriates granted work permits. According to him, the act that aims to produce more experts, identify local skilled manpower and mentor younger generations has been neglected. He said, “We have noticed over the years that certain critical sections of executive order 5 are not being fully implemented. “The order stipulates that if there is a missing skill in Nigeria, that contractor or company is allowed to bring expatriates but there must be two Nigerian engineers that will understudy them. “Unfortunately, our checks have revealed that despite the abundance of databases for Engineers, Technologists and Artisans in Nigeria, what we find in many construction sites across the country are expatriates of equal qualifications, and some even without skills. “We do not find this acceptable and want to draw the attention of relevant authorities to this anomaly, stressing that those sections of the PEO 5 will be implemented to the latter.
