The President-elect, Asíwájú Bola Tinubu, breezed into Lagos on Sunday where he was received by a mammoth crowd of supporters and party members after his private jet landed at the presidential wing of the Murtala Muhammed Airport in Ikeja. Tinubu proceeded to the Iga-Iduganran palace of the Oba of Lagos, Rilwanu Akiolu, where the monarch and traditional chiefs were waiting. The development is coming five days after the former Lagos State governor was announced the winner of the contentious presidential poll held on February 25. Tinubu had polled 8,794,726 votes to defeat his closest rivals, Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party and Labour Party candidate, Peter Obi, who had 6,984,520 and 6,101,533 votes respectively. Earlier, Tinubu was received at the airport by Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; Chief of Staff, Tayo Ayinde; former Lagos Deputy Governor, Femi Pedro; veteran politician Senator Musiliu Obanikoro; former Commissioner for Environment in Lagos, Muiz Banire and Woman Leader in the state, Jumoke Okoya-Thomas. This was disclosed in a statement issued on Sunday by the media adviser of president-elect, Tunde Rahman. Rahman stated that shortly after his arrival, the delegation proceeded to the palace of Oba Akiolu. Addressing the modest crowd gathered inside the palace, TInubu reassured Nigerians that he would not disappoint them. According to him, he would work assiduously for Nigeria and would not disappoint the people. While thanking God and the people for his eventual victory, he likened the primary and election he went through to a World Cup tournament which was tricky and unpredictable. Reacting to his homecoming, Akiolu described the President-elect as a special breed “who is destined for leadership at the very top.” Other traditional rulers gathered at the palace were the monarch of Ikate-Elegushi Kingdom, Oba Saheed Elegushi and the Oniru of Iruland, Oba Omogbolahan Lawal.
