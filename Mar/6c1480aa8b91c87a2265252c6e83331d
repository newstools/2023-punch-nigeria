All these occurred while Nigerians struggle with naira scarcity due to the naira redesign policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria and petrol scarcity. Among other things, the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, had said one of the objectives of the naira design policy was to mop up currency outside the bank vaults, which he put at N2.7tn. He said with such a huge amount outside the banking system, it would be difficult for monetary policy initiatives to impact the economy. Emefiele had announced in October last year that the bank would release re-designed naira notes by December 15, 2022. According to the CBN governor, this was targeted at controlling currency in circulation, curbing counterfeit currency and ransom payments to kidnappers and terrorists. He noted, “Indeed, the integrity of a local legal tender, the efficiency of its supply and its efficacy in the conduct of monetary policy are some of the hallmarks of a great central bank. “In recent times, however, currency management has faced several daunting challenges that have continued to grow in scale and sophistication with attendant and unintended consequences for the integrity of both the CBN and the country.” The IMF urged the CBN to be cautious of the naira design policy because of the disruption to trade and payments being caused by a shortage of new notes, which has led to hardship for Nigerians.
