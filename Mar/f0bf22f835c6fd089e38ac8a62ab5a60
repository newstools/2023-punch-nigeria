Officers of the Nigerian Navy who ‘invaded’ the Enerhen Divisional Police Station in Uvwie Local Government Area have been arrested and detained. A naval officer during the incident at the station was said to have beaten up a police sergeant. In a trending video of the incident, policemen were begging their colleague, identified simply as Kingsley, not to take laws into his hands. But the angry Kingsley who had blood on his right eye took off his uniform. One of the policemen, who was recording the video, threatened to open a teargas canister on the Navy man. When contacted, the spokesperson for the Nigerian Navy, Adedotun Ayo-Vaughan, said the naval officials were in detention for “quick investigation”. He said, “Good morning. They have been arrested and detained for quick investigation and strict disciplinary action.”
