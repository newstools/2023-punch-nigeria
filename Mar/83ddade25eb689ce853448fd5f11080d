In a bid to eradicate the menace of bleaching creams and needless waste of scarce resources, The Director General of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, Mojisola Adeyeye, has urged Nigerians to be aware of the dangers associated with such creams. Adeyeye, while educating on the dangers associated with the use of bleaching creams, said such substances could result in cancer slowly building up in the body, doing damage to vital organs of the body and causing skin irritation, among others. She made this known while delivering a speech at the beginning of the South-West zonal media sensitisation workshop tagged,  “I’m Black and Proud,” at the House of Chiefs Hall, Agodi Secretariat in Ibadan, Oyo State. She said, “Last year, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, acting on the resolutions of the Senate, wrote to NAFDAC, stressing the need to take stringent regulatory actions to stem the dangerous tide of rampant and pervasive cases of Nigerians using bleaching creams. “We immediately took some decisive steps, such as sensitisation of the public through different media outlets, enforcement through intelligence and raids in trade fair complexes that have resulted in large seizures and destruction of violative products. One such sensitisation action was the commencement of media sensitisation workshops organised for journalists in Abuja, Lagos and Kano.
