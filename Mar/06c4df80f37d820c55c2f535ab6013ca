Former Governor of Ogun State and a chieftain of the  All Progressives Congress in the state, Senator  Ibikunle Amosun, has begun canvassing votes for  the governorship candidate of the African Democratic Congress, Biyi Otegbeye, ahead of the March 11, 2023. Amosun, who is currently the senator representing Ogun Central at the National Assembly, had led a campaign rally for the ADC candidate at  Ado-Odo/Ota, Sagamu, Ogun waterside,  among other local government areas of the state. A  statement by the ADC Campaign Council  Media Director, Raheem Ajayi, quoted  Amosun as saying  Otegbeye was the right person to restore Ogun State to the path of development. The former governor was also reported to have lamented that Ogun standard policy had been abandoned under the current APC administration of Governor Dapo Abiodun. “If the current government cared about continuity, by now, Ogun State would have grown in leaps and bounds. But what do we see today? Retrogression. And that is why I am out; that is why we must return to that path of development, that path of glory, that path of ‘we are Ogun State.’ “Somebody came and reduced the six-lane road to two-lane. Is there any sense in this? We should not draw back development.” He, therefore, urged the people of Ogun State to vote for Otegbeye and the ADC in the upcoming gubernatorial election, scheduled for March 11. He said, “That’s why I rise up to call on you. Let’s come out in large numbers on March 11 to cast our votes for ADC and Biyi Otegbeye. On that day, let’s exercise patience and wait until the votes are counted. Don’t give room to thuggery and rigging.” In his remarks, Otegbeye promised to create opportunities for all and preserve the legacies of past leaders in the state. He said, ”I want to assure you that the legacies of our leaders in Ogun State that we point to,  and are proud of, will be preserved and enhanced. “We don’t want the standard to continue falling. Right now, there is no standard anymore.”
