A women leader in the All Progressives Congress in Kwara State, Hajia Hud Shekinat, has appealed to the people of the state to support the re-election of Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq for a second term in office, saying that no administration since the creation of the state has given women recognition than that of the incumbent. Speaking at a press conference/prayer session organised by AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq Progressive Platform for the re-election of Governor AbdulRazaq in Ilorin on Sunday, Hud said that the governor in his first term gave more attention to the cause of women in the state. “AA made us proud as women in the state during his first term, he brought us to the limelight. We are not restricted to the kitchen like some people would say so we have no other option than to support his re-election so that the good works can continue. “No other candidate has his capacity and competence, so we are for Governor AbdulRazaq because of what he’s doing, particularly for women,” she said. She added that women also “benefitted scholarship, road constructions, empowerment and several others. We benefited more than we experienced in the last 16 years.” Also speaking at the programme, an octogenarian and one of the chieftains of the APC in Kwara State, Alhaji Azeez Adebayo, said the administration of the governor was divinely ordained in the history of the creation of the state. He, therefore, called for his re-election in the Saturday, March 18, 2023 election. Adebayo, the convener of AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq Progressive Platform, said, “The current administration of Mallam AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq was divinely ordained by God and that is why in the last four years, his achievements surpassed what the past administrations did in the last 16 years. “The imprints of the genuine and people-oriented administration of governor AbdulRazaq is felt across the nooks and crannies of the State because he has compassion for the masses and is genuinely interested in moving the state forward. “Therefore, whatever members of the opposition are saying now should be ignored because they have nothing to offer, they are enemies of Kwara state. “Those who have been living in Kwara would know that the past governments primarily shared allocations to the state since its creation and did little or nothing to progress the state.” The central coordinator of AAPP, Alhaji Ayuba Aduragba, in his address listed the monumental achievements of Governor AbdulRazaq in the last four years and called on all and sundry to vote for him in his re-election bid on Saturday. “We are calling on all and sundry to vote for governor AbdulRazaq on Saturday so that the good work will continue and more developmental projects would be implemented for the benefit of the generality of the people,” he said.
