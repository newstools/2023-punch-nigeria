A new chairman of Labour Party in Imo State, Festus Onyekwulisi, has assumed office with a promise that the Labour Party will sack the governor of the state, Hope Uzodimma, during the next election. Briefing journalists on Friday at the party secretariat in Owerri, the state capital, Onyekwulisi said he and other members of the state working committee would ensure that the party’s governorship primary election which comes up in April would be credible. He added that the party would protect their votes during the House of Assembly election, which will be held on March 18. Onyekwulisi, who described LP as a movement, said the best way to win the state governorship election in November was to apply transparency during the primary election of the party. He said the Imo people had suffered, adding that the LP administration would ensure that they began to enjoy the dividends of democracy again. Onyekwulisi said, “We have begun the process of recovering Imo State. The first step is to hold a transparent primary election. In all, this transparency will be our watchword. Let me say it again that we are nobody’s stooge, and that the Labour Party in Imo State is not factionalised. “We are committed to a new Imo State. Labour Party administration will bring dividends of democracy to the Imo people. We are men and women of proven integrity. We have modelled ourselves to Peter Obi. We are here to do what is right. I am only a stooge to my conscience.”
