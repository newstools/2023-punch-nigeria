The leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress has issued a seven-day ultimatum to the Federal Government to end the naira scarcity in the country. The labour union threatened to go on strike if the issue was not resolved at the expiration of the ultimatum. The President of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Joe Ajaero, gave the ultimatum on Monday in Abuja, at the opening session of the Central Working Committee meeting of the labour union. Ajaero, who frowned at the hardship being faced by Nigerians following the naira redesign policy of the Federal Government, warned that on the expiration of the seven days, workers would be directed to stay away from work if nothing was done to ameliorate the situation. Ajaero also condemned the fuel scarcity in the country, lamenting that workers and Nigerians were being pushed to the wall. “On this issue of fuel scarcity and cash crunch, the Congress wishes to inform the Federal Government that we will no longer keep quiet. “The NLC is giving the Central Bank of Nigeria and the FG seven working days, if they fail to do the needful at the expiration of the seven days, all workers in Nigeria should stay at home,” Ajaero said before the meeting went into a closed-door session.
