The Lagos State Ministry of Justice has opposed exhuming the remains of the late Whitney Adeniran after confirming the result of her death as asphyxia and electrocution in a proven autopsy conducted by Lagos State University Teaching Hospital. Recall that her death occurred amid the school’s inter-house sports activities on Thursday, February 9 at the Agege Stadium. In a statement by the Director, Public Affairs of the ministry, Alo Grace, on Saturday, it read, “Adeniran’s death was as a result of asphyxia and electrocution, as indicated by an autopsy conducted by Lagos State University Teaching Hospital. “The Lagos State Ministry of Justice is aware of the current ongoing dialogue about the alleged plans to exhume the body of the late Whitney Omodesola Adeniran, a student of Chrisland Schools whose death as revealed by the autopsy, conducted by Lagos State University Teaching Hospital was as a result of asphyxia and electrocution,” the statement reads in part. “Whilst we have not received any such official communication requesting for exhumation, however, if and when we do receive such a request, we shall be opposed to it. “In any event, the circumstances for exhumation under the Coroners’ Systems Law, 2015 do not arise in this case. Additionally, it is not our intention to further traumatise the deceased’s family.” Meanwhile, the ministry noted that it was working closely with the police who had reportedly given their reassurance that the duplicate case file would be forwarded on Monday, March 6, 2023, to the Directorate of Public Prosecutions to aid the speedy issuance of legal advice.
