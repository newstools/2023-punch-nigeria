The immediate past chairman, Ekiti State Council of Traditional Rulers and the Alawe of Ilawe Ekiti, Oba Adebanji Alabi, has hailed the February 25 presidential election, describing it as free, fair and credible. Alabi urged the contestants, who lost in the presidential election “to accept the outcome of the result in good faith”, saying that “unnecessary distraction will slow down the development of the country”. The traditional ruler, who spoke to journalists at Ilawe Ekiti on Sunday, also praised the Supreme Court verdict on the naira redesigning policy and called on the Federal Government and the Central Bank of Nigeria “to obey the judgment by immediately releasing money to the banks so that Nigerians will have access to cash rather than allowing them to suffer. “The new and old naira notes should quickly be made available to bring to an end the hardship in the country,” the monarch said. He said that the fact that the All Progressives Congress lost in some of its strongholds like Lagos, Katsina, Kano and Kaduna among others during the presidential poll was a pointer to the fact that the election was free, fair and credible. While congratulating the president-elect, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, who he described as “tested and trusted” on his victory, Alabi urged him not to forget his promise of supporting the development of Ekiti economically and considering Ekiti State in the scheme of things”. He expressed confidence that “Tinubu will not disappoint Nigerians and indeed Ekiti State who voted massively for him”. The monarch also lauded Ekiti State governor, Biodun Oyebanji, for his performance since assumption of office in October last year.
