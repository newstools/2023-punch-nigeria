The Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has assured the residents of the state that his administration will remain committed to providing even development without any form of religion or political affiliation. Sanwo-Olu, who spoke through his Commissioner for Communication and Strategy, Gbenga Omotosho, in an exclusive chat with The PUNCH on Tuesday, said he would continue what he had been doing since he assumed office. According to him, the outcome of Saturday’s presidential election in the state would not affect the quality governance. He said, “If see the statement that Mr Sanwo-Olu issued earlier about peace in Lagos State, he asked people not to foment trouble; he said he had run Lagos for almost four years without any form of discrimination along ethnic, racial, or religious lines And the development process has been spread evenly all over the state, and that is going to continue. “That we lost the presidential election does not mean that we are going to lose the grip on government. “We will continue to work for all Lagosians, including visitors. We will continue to do all sorts of things that will endear us to the minds of Lagosians.” Recall that in the Saturday presidential election, former governor of the state and APC presidential flagbearer Bola Ahmed Tinubu was defeated by Labour Party candidate, Peter Obi. This created a pocket of tension in the state on Monday, thereby, making the governor to call on the people of the state to be calm and eschew any act that could lead to a breakdown of law and order.
