The presidential candidate of the Labour Party in the 2023 presidential election, Peter Obi, has postponed his scheduled visit to Abia State today. Obi was earlier billed to be in the state to campaign for the LP governorship candidate Chief Alex Otti. A statement signed by the Special Adviser to Otti on Media and Publicity, Mr Ferdinand Ekeoma, confirmed the postponement of Obi’s visit to The PUNCH on Tuesday. Ekeoma stated that the shift was due to some emergency engagements which Obi will be having in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, today. He, however, pointed out that Obi has assured that the visit must take place before the governorship election in the state. “While we hope to communicate a new date to Ndi Abia, we sincerely regret any inconveniences which the postponement may have caused them,” he added.
