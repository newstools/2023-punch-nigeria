The Atiku-Okowa Presidential Campaign Council of the Peoples Democratic Party has vowed to challenge the outcome of the February 25 presidential election that returned the candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, as President-elect. The campaign also urged party supporters to be worry-free as efforts are being made to retrieve the party’s mandate. Speaking on Wednesday evening through a statement by the spokesperson and Director, Public Affairs of the campaign committee, Dino Melaye, described the outcome of the election a “grave injustice.” Melaye in a terse statement stated, “A clarion call on all Atiku’s supporters all over the world not to be perturbed. Weeping may tarry till night but joy cometh in the morning. This grave injustice shall not stand. The battle to retrieve our stolen mandate is a battle of no retreat, no surrender. We shall overcome.” The PUNCH reported how the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Yakubu Mahmoud, in the early hours of Wednesday, announced Tinubu as the President-elect, after polling 8,794,726 votes to defeat his closest rival, Atiku who polled 6,984,520 and the Labour Party’s Peter Obi who polled 6,101,533.
