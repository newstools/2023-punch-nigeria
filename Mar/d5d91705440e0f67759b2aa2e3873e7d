 The forum of the 2019 governorship candidates in Taraba State, on Wednesday, endorsed the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Col. Agbu Kefas (retd.), as their preferred candidate for the March 11 governorship election. The Chairman of the forum and Chieftain of the Labour Party, Mr. Kefas Sule, disclosed on behalf of the other 18 members. Sule, who served as a Director of Publicity, Labour Party Presidential Campaign Council for Taraba, at a press briefing in Jalingo, said the decision was taken after due consultation and scrutiny of all candidates contesting to be governor of the state. “The forum, after wide consultation, found Col. Agbu Kefas as the best candidate to deliver the desired dividends of democracy to the people, tapping from his military experience. “Taraba state is abundantly blessed with everything that is required to guarantee good quality life for the citizens is not in doubt. The problem has always been with the quality of leadership. If we get the leadership question right, every other factor will fall into place and our State will become a reference point in Nigeria. The forum noted it found Kefas as the most suitable candidate for the job in the state. “So, as we prepare to elect a new governor and legislators in a matter of days, we need not just any politician, but those with the best interest of the State at heart, in addition to the necessary experience. We need as the governor, somebody that can steer the ship of the state from the usual failed expectations and disappointments that have been our bane,” the forum added. It called on the Taraba electorate to give Kefas an opportunity by massively voting for him on Saturday.
