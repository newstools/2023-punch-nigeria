Women across the three senatorial districts of Kogi State have called for the cancellation of the February 25 presidential and National Assembly elections that produced Asiwaju Bola Tinubu as the president-elect. The women in a press conference in Lokoja hinged their reasons for the call on the “chaos, brigandage, widespread violence, bloodlets and even deaths that characterised the election. Esther Opaluwa who spoke on behalf of the group, said, “As you are all aware, a significant date in the history of Nigeria just passed, a date that has become a watershed in the democratic story of Nigeria. Indeed February 25, 2023 was a date all Nigerians home and abroad waited for with bated breath, for it was a date that will make the beginning of another democratic dispensation in our country and everyone including our youth and women eagerly participated in all the activities that led to that date. “But the day ended in chaos, brigandage, widespread violence,  bloodlets and even deaths. As we lament and mourn over what had happened during the day at almost all the polling stations, our traumatised sensibilities were further damaged by what we were seeing right there on the screens of our televisions which was quite the opposite of what the Federal Government and our President, Mohammadu Buhari, the NASS, the security chiefs and even the umpire of the electoral processes had been assuring us will happen”. The women also called for the prosecution of the perpetrators of violence around Kogi State and urged Governor Yahaya Bello to leave up to his responsibility as the chief security officer of the state.
