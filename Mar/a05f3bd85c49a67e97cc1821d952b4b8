Governor Aminu Masari on Wednesday described the election of the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, as President-elect as the right choice. He described the President-elect as a square peg in a square hole. Masari passed the comments shortly after the Independent National Electoral Commission had announced Tinubu as winner of the 2023 presidential election. He added that the President-elect was intelligent, resourceful and accommodating. The Governor and some members of his cabinet had kept vigil at the Government House, Katsina, watching as the results were being announced by INEC. Masari, who spoke with newsmen shortly after the declaration of the results, lauded INEC, security officers and Nigerians generally over the conduct of the election. The Governor declared, ”God has vindicated me and other Nigerians by disappointing those who doubted INEC’s ability” to conduct credible elections. “We have delivered because we turned out en masse with our supporters and voted Bola Tinubu as our President. “I am still appealing to our supporters to come out in large numbers and elect Umar Dikko-Radda, to succeed me as next Governor of Katsina State in the gubernatorial election slated for March 11, 2023,” he added.
