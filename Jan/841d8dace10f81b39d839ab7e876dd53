Clerics in Edo State have urged their members to collect their permanent voter cards and vote candidates with proven character into offices in the 2023 general election. The clerics who stated this at the Edo Ministers Elders’ Caucus forum said it was time to halt the untold hardship being suffered by Nigerians by voting for the right people. The Founder of Life Renewal Ministries, Apostle Godwin Ojo, appealed to the congregation to collect their PVCs to enable them to vote for the right candidates that would rescue the country from the pain and agony the All Progressives Congress government had allegedly brought on them. He also urged them to be steadfast in praying for the Church and the nation in general. He said, “Let me tell you a fact. If you don’t have the PVCs, you have no voice in this election discussion. No matter how you speak and mobilise, you have no voice. It is only those who have the PVCs that have a voice. Politics is a game of numbers,” he added. On his part, the Head of National Publicity, Contact and Mobilisation, Obi-Datti Presidential Campaign Council, Evangelist Tony Ekhine, appealed to the participants to vote for Peter Obi who has the fear of God, a listening ear, and good character. Ekhine also stated that Obi possessed all the attributes to become the president of Nigeria. He claimed that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), promised Nigerians so much but achieved nothing. “This moment requires all of us to get our PVCs to march forward to change the narrative of leadership in Nigeria. You will get your PVCs no matter the games the ruling APC government is playing. Because plans are on ground to deny Nigerians their PVCs, especially in the region where Obi is popular. “So we are in the court to fight against it. We are going to mobilise more civil society organisations to join us in the fight. Be vigilant and be ready to vote,” he added.
