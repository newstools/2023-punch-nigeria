As the world welcomes the New Year, 2023, Africa did so differently as there have been key notable dates in the year earmarked to usher in new governments in 24 countries of the continent. According to Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa, countries like Nigeria, Gabon, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Somaliland, Sudan, and Zimbabwe will be conducting their presidential elections. Other countries include the Central African Republic, Comoros, Côte d’Ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Togo and Swaziland for regional, district and local elections. With Nigeria being one of the world’s focus, the Independent National Electoral Commission has restated its commitment to ensuring that there is a free, fair and credible election scheduled to hold on February 23. The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), corroborated INEC’s position on delivering a free and fair election at an interactive session entitled, “A conversation with President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria,” co-hosted by the United State Institute of Peace, the International Republican Institute, the National Endowment for Democracy, and the International Foundation for Electoral Systems. He said, “INEC is ready because I made sure they were given all the resources they asked because I don’t want any excuses that they were denied funds by the government.” In the build-up to the election, 18 political parties have fielded candidates and their running mates, with the major ones being Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress; Abubakar Atiku of the Peoples Democratic Party; Peter Obi of the Labour Party and Rabiu Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria Peoples Party. Others are Imumolen Christopher (Accord Party), Al-Mustapha Hamza (Action Alliance), Sowore Omoyele (African Action Congress), Kachikwu Dumebi (African Democratic Congress), Sani Yabagi Yusuf (Action Democratic Party), Umeadi Peter Nnanna (All Progressives Grand Alliance), Ojei Princess Chichi – Allied People’s Movement (APM), Nnamdi Charles Osita (Action Peoples Party), Adenuga Sunday Oluwafemi (Boot Party), Osakwe Felix Johnson (National Rescue Movement), Abiola Latifu Kolawole (Peoples Redemption Party), Adebayo Adewole Ebenezer (Social Democratic Party), Ado-Ibrahim Abdumalik (Young Progressives Party), and Nwanyanwu Daniel Daberechukwu (Zenith Labour Party).
