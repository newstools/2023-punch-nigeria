A former President, Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers, Dr Teslim Adekunle Sanusi, has emphasised the need for individuals and corporate organisations to give to the needy. A statement said while celebrating his 80th birthday by organising medical outreach for the downtrodden in the society, he said this was necessary to alleviate poverty. He said, “I asked my friends, family and associates to contribute and we aggregated all that was given to organise the medical outreach. I urge the elite to give to the needy. No one gets poorer by giving and the more one gives, the more he or she gets in return.” Also speaking at the event, the Chairman of the Central Planning Committee for Teslim Adekunle at 80, Mrs Ekeoma Ezibe, said the committee ensured giving to the needy. Ezeibe, who is the vice president of the Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers, stated that eye tests were conducted on people and those who needed glasses were given, while those that needed surgeries had operations performed on them. She said that many were screened for diabetes and those that required drugs were given the same, adding that they were counselled on how to live right and manage the disease. She disclosed that eyeglasses were given to about 800 people and surgeries were performed on more than 100 people and counting, adding that thousands of people were fed during the exercise.
