The Osun State Chapter of the New Nigeria People Party has vowed to fight vote-buying and other illegal practices that can pose a threat to credible elections in the state. The NNPC state chairman, Oluwatosin Odeyemi, made this known at the party secretariat on Thursday in Osogbo. He further stated all corrupt practices would not be accepted before, during or after the election exercise in the state saying the votes of Osun people must count. He said “I’m telling this to the opposition to know that it’s no more business as usual. As the NNPP has come together as one family, we are going to allow the votes of the people count and send them a positive signal that there is no longer any vote buying. The Osun State NNPP chairman further said that the NNPP would garner a significant number votes for the party’s presidential candidate, Rabiu Kwankwaso.
