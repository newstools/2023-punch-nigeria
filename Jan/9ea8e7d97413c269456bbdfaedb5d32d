An actress and filmmaker, Mojisola Adebanjo, says many Nigerian men find it hard to date and trust actresses because they are always around people, and have several things written about them. She told Sunday Scoop, “From experience, I have realised that many men find it hard being in serious relationships with actress. It is usually so hard for them to trust us, because they feel we are in everyone’s faces; coupled with all the stories usually written about actress. A lot of men are actually scared to date actresses.” Recounting her first experience on a movie set, she said, “My first experience was a sweet one. I had mixed feelings; I was excited and scared at the same time because there were many popular actors there. However, I finally summoned courage to do what I had always loved and wanted to do. I had to resign from my regular job to face my acting career.” On if she feels Nollywood is ‘friendly’ towards women, the actress said, “Yes, the industry is friendly to women. If a woman knows what she wants and is good at what she does too, the industry will be friendly towards her.” The actress also stated that though she could marry a younger lover, the age difference should not be too wide. “There is nothing is wrong with marrying a younger lover. Like they say, ‘age is just a number’. However, I prefer my man older than me, but not too old. I love men who are mature, understanding, and think outside the box.”
