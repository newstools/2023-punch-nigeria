The Department of State Services has raised the alarm over an alleged plot by politicians and “disgruntled elements” against its Director General, Yusuf Magaji Bichi. The DSS spokesman, Peter Afunanya, in a statement on Tuesday noted that it uncovered plots by some politicians to sponsor a smear campaign against Bichi. Afunanya also accused the plotters of employing Non-Governmental Organisations to discredit Bichi and hold press conferences against him. The statement partly read, “Also, sections of the media have been briefed to implement the strategy through sponsored articles, commentaries and features to malign the DG, his family and select officials of the Service. “The Service is monitoring developments and will allow the plotters to either exhaust themselves or rescind the plan of action. Otherwise, no amount of intimidation, harassment and blackmail will deter it from discharging its duties. “However, it would not idly watch a group of dissatisfied gang to undermine the Service and its highly dedicated leadership and management. “The DSS, therefore, wishes to inform the public to be wary of these tendencies and ignore the antics of dark forces out to impugn the character of the DG. ”It restates its unalloyed support to the President on his resolve to continue to confront head-on, threats to national security as well as create the enabling environment necessary for the 2023 general elections to hold.” The statement comes after a report that Bichi’s wife, Aisha, ordered the arrest of the Kano State governorship candidate of the New Nigerian Peoples Party, Abba Yusuf. The PUNCH had reported on Monday Aisha ordered the arrest of Yusuf following a confrontation between him and the DSS DG wife at the VIP lounge gate of the Aminu Kano International Airport Sunday night. However, Bichi’s son, Abba, had debunked the reports, stating that his mother didn’t order the arrest.
