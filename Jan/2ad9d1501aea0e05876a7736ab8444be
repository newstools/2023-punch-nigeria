The Nigerian Aviation Handling Company Plc has assured its shareholders and the general public of its commitment to provide a continued aviation service to its clients. This is coming after the disruption caused by industrial action embarked on by the members of the National Union of Air Transport Employees and Air Transport Senior Staff Services Association over agitation for a salary increase, as well as the perceived unyielding stance of the NAHCO to accede to the unions’ demand. In a public disclosure filed and signed by the Company’s Secretary, Bello Abdullahi, NAHCO said even though the action violated the interim injunction granted by the National Industrial Court on 20th January 2023, the down tooling did not cause a major impact on the business of NAHCO as it lasted for only a few hours. On the way forward, NAHCO, however, said the resolutions reached after meeting with the unions and other critical stakeholders included the discontinuance of the suit filed against the NUATE and ATTSSSAN unions at the National Industrial Court; issuance of a counteroffer to the union’s demands by the NAHCO Plc management before the closing of business on January 23, 2023; commencement of negotiations on salary increment on Wednesday, January 25, 2023, and conclusion by Saturday, January 28th, 2023; the immediate resumption of all staff to work, and non-victimization of staff due to participation in the strike action.
