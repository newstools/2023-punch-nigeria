Multi-award-winning artiste and Afrobeat sensation, Damini Ebunoluwa Ogulu, popularly known as Burna Boy, has apologised to his fans for coming late for his Lagos concert on Monday morning. Burna Boy had on stage blamed the organisers for the reason behind his late performance at the event, themed, ‘Love Damini Concert’. However, fans have taken to social media to vent their anger about his lateness to the event citing disregard and wickedness for them. Reacting to the outburst, the Grammy-award winner wrote on his verified Instagram handle, “Lagos, I love you but I can’t do this again. The organisational structure and infrastructure are not there for the complexities of my audio and production needs. “Let’s be clear. I wasn’t late, my band wasn’t late. We pride ourselves on being highly professional, especially with our stagecraft. There were three options available to me; wait for the audio to be fixed and delay the show, come out at 11 pm as planned with no sound or call a breach of contract and pull the plug. Going forward, Burna Boy said he is working with some investors and stakeholders who are forestalling future occurrences because he wants to continue to give his fans top-notch performances. “I know I can’t go all over the world and neglect my own people so I’m taking matters into my own hands! I’m gathering the troops to work on building world-class infrastructure in the Nigerian entertainment business. “Investors and stakeholders interested pls hit me up, we need to make some changes. “I apologise to my fans for how hectic it was, thank you for staying and weathering the storm with me. “I commend my band @fromtheoutsiders for making lemonade with the worst lemons we’ve ever seen! “Wonder X, KC Kennedy Olisa Adibua and Creative Economy Catalyst (CEC) did an abysmal job of executing anything and my fans should never have had to go through that. “I’lI see you all again, on spaceship time! No one else’s. “Love, Damini,” he wrote.
