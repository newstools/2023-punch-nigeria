The Peoples Democratic Party in Jigawa State has received a former two-term deputy governor in the state, Alhaji Ahmed Gumel, who resigned his membership of the All Progressives Congress last week. This was disclosed in a statement made available to The PUNCH by the Deputy Director, Media and Publicity, Santuraki Campaign Directorate, Umar Madamuwa. The statement read, “No doubt his resignation has opened the exit route for many politicians who are presently in the ‘highly tensed political room’ called APC, his exit will also serve as a wake-up call for the regrouping of the progressives under their known mentor, Dr Sule Lamido. “Meanwhile, a very colourful reception was organised by the PDP at Bamaina Town, the headquarters of progressive politics to welcome the former deputy governor back to his former party during which he was issued his membership card. “There is no political scientist to fault the political Matthew here in Jigawa State. Come 2023, Saminu Turaki with Ahmed Mahmoud and Lamido will lead to victory for the PDP while Mohammed Badaru, Umar Danmodi and the APC without Ahmed Mahmoud equal defeat.” The statement also faulted the effort of APC stalwarts, who have reportedly pleaded with Gumel to withdraw his resignation letter. “To all right-thinking people, the APC is getting it wrong here and it even amounts to political immaturity to expect Alhaji Ahmed Gumel to withdraw a letter he honourably wrote and with his honourable hand, real desperation by the APC,” it added.
