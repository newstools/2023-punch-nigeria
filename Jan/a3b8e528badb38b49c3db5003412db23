Frank Lampard has broken his silence on Instagram after he was sacked by Everton on Monday. The Chelsea legend was sacked on Monday after a 2-0 defeat at West Ham – Everton’s 11th loss in their last 14 games in all competitions. On Thursday night, Lampard took to social media and admitted he was “disappointed” that he couldn’t achieve more at Goodison Park. Alongside a photo of him celebrating alongside Everton fans, he said, “Coming in to Everton last year I knew we were in a tough moment and I will always be proud of the incredible work and support from everyone involved to keep the team in the Premier League last season. Thanks to everybody that played their part as the whole club came together. I will never forget the incredible night against Palace that we shared. “I want to thank all Evertonians for the welcome that you gave to myself, my staff, and my family. It truly is a special club with a huge heart, and an incredible history. I’m disappointed that we couldn’t achieve more together and wish all the players and everyone at Everton FC the very best for the future ”
