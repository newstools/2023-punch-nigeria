The campaign council of the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, has condemned Monday’s attack on the convoy of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), in Kano. In a statement signed by the head of media of the campaign council, Diran Onifade, the campaign team described the action as “barbaric and un-Nigerian” and condemned it in the strongest terms. The statement read in part, “The President represents the sovereignty of the Nigerian nation, and Buhari particularly, his age considered, is a father figure, an assault on whom, our culture regards as sacrilegious. “It is imperative that the despicable action such as what took place in Kano, and other attacks on candidates and supporters elsewhere this election season are checked by condemnation by political leaders across board. “While we as a political party, strictly adhere to our commitment to an issue-based campaign, we notice with regret, the arrogant and belligerent rhetoric of some politicians who, with all desperation, still consider this year’s election as do or die. “It must be made clear that this intolerant and intemperate approach is capable of heating the polity, while directly encouraging the kind of misconduct that occurred in Kano. “We would like to strongly reiterate that politics is not war, and politicians should carry out the campaigns, without interfering with the right of the people of Nigeria to choose their leaders on free will. ‘We sympathise with President Buhari and urge our law enforcement agencies to rise to the occasion, by appropriately investigating and bringing these violent perpetrators, and their instigators, before the law. “Our future depends on a peaceful and stable polity, and we urge our supporters, and the good people of Nigeria, to remain steadfast and determined in expressing their electoral choice and participating in this process, but never to lose their calm and discretion.”
