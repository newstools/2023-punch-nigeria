Fans of music star, Burna Boy, lamented on the singer’s late entry to his Lagos concert on Sunday night. Angry attendees took to Twitter to call out the singer for starting his performance late at the event themed ‘Love Damini Concert’. According to attendees, the show started at 9pm and Burna Boy didn’t show up on stage till about 3am. Entertainment commentator, Joey Akan, tweeted, “You queue for six hours for fuel;still stand six hours for Burna Boy. Life tough!” Sharing a video from the event, @ade_adeayo tweeted, “The situation on ground. Almost 2am and Burna Boy’s concert is basically yet to start. “Some people have been around since 9pm. For an artist with the highest level of international exposure, this is beyond terrible and unprofessional.” Giving an update, the tweep wrote, “The band is playing and Burna Boy appears on stage at 3:30. “All is forgiven and the crowd cheers. No lesson learnt. Goodnight guys and happy new year. “And mind you, there was no apology. He even claimed it was out of goodwill and Seyi Vibez pleading that he choose to remain at the venue.” After his appearance, Burna Boy had slammed lashed out at fans who attended his show in Lagos on Sunday, as he recounted how he was accused of killing someone in the club in August 2022. The singer stated that he would have gone home if it hadn’t been for another artiste, Seyi Vibes. Speaking in Pidgin English, he said, “If no be Seyi Vibes, I for just don dey go house. But I dey here with una, after you na don talk sey I kill person for Cubana, after una don talk say my mama dance for Fela.” After blowing hot, the singer performed his hit songs to the waiting fans who cheered him despite their earlier displeasure.
