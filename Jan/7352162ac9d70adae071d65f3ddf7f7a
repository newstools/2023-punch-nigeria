Nigeria’s external reserves fell by $3.43bn in 2022, according to figures obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria. The CBN disclosed in its movement on external reserves figures that the reserves which stood at $40.52bn as of the end of December 31, 2021, ended December 29, 2022 at $37.09bn. At the last Monetary Policy Committee meeting of the CBN in November, the Governor, CBN, Godwin Emefiele, said, “The committee observed the decline in the external reserves position, as gross external reserves decreased by 1.34 per cent at end-October 2022 to $36.87bn, from $37.39bn at end-September 2022. “With indications of lower crude oil prices in the futures market, members urged the Bank to sustain its current policies to boost non-oil exports in order to shore up the external reserves.” A member of the MPC, Robert Asogwa, said, “The recent drop in external reserves is, however, linked to the decline in oil exports even at a time of higher oil prices. “Interestingly, the publicised reduction in oil thefts across the Niger delta and the rising prospects of increased overseas remittances would likely boost the gross external reserves to a large extent in early 2023.”
