The Governor of Osun State, Ademola Adeleke, has urged his predecessor, Adegboyega Oyetola, to stop listening to the devil’s whispering on a possible return to office as governor. Adeleke said this while reacting to Oyetola, who, while addressing members of the All Progressives Congress at a prayer session organised to welcome him to the state in Osogbo, said he heard from God that he would return to office as governor and that the APC presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, would be elected president. A statement by the spokesperson for the governor, Olawale Rasheed, on behalf of Adeleke, then declared that, “God is of justice, equity and honesty, not of electoral banditry and deceit. “The holy books even noted that the devil’s whispering is real and no one should mistake the voice of the devil for God. Our Almighty God has spoken resoundingly in favour of a new Governor, Senator Ademola Adeleke. Mr Oyetola should better be reading ‘auzubilahi mina shaytani rajeem’ so he could hear the true voice of God – that a new leader is anointed by divine will for Osun people.” Reminding Oyetola that there was life after losing the election, Adeleke affirmed that Osun people have moved and were at the moment started enjoying “a new governance of openness, accountability, and responsiveness to yearnings and aspirations of the citizenry. “Osun has launched a new chapter. This new leadership has returned state power to the people who are now feeling the new air of government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Never will Osun be returned to the years of the locust.”
