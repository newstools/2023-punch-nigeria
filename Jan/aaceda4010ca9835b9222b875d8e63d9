The Peoples Democratic Party governorship candidate for Lagos State, Olajide Adediran popularly known as Jandor, has agreed to attend the governorship debate organised for Lagos candidates. The Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who is seeking re-election under the All Progressives Congress platform had withdrawn from the debate, citing security reasons. But in a world conference held on Saturday, Jandor faulted Sanwo-Olu’s reason for withdrawing from the debate. Vanguard quoted Jandor as saying, “This speaks volume of Governor Sanwo-Olu as Chief Security Officer of the state as he cannot guarantee his own safety. He added, “It just worries me that the Chief Security Officer of a state is saying he is not safe. I am safe and I will go everywhere in Lagos. “The debate wasn’t put together for me or Sanwo-Olu, it is for people of Lagos State. I will go, he has given me role of big brother to play. “I will go because I want people of Lagos to listen to me and know what I want to offer. This 2023, they wouldn’t come again.” Jandor also decried the series of attacks targeted at his campaign train, as he asked the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, to work towards securing the nation ahead of the general elections. Jandor’s campaign convoy was attacked in the Aguda area of Surulere Local Government Area of the state on Friday, leaving three injured. The latest attack makes it the third one experienced by Jandor’s convoy in the last few days. His campaign train had been attacked by thugs in Badagry, Ikorodu, Agege, Kosofe and Surulere, leaving some of his followers wounded and vehicles vandalised.
