Popular and award-winning afrobeat singer, Ayodeji Balogun, professionally known as Wizkid and comedian Freedom Atsepoyi, popularly called Mr Jollof are in exchange of words over the singer’s hint to hold a world tour with his colleague, Davido. The PUNCH had earlier reported that Wizkid hinted a tour collaboration with Davido. On his verified Instagram, Wizkid wrote in his story, “After my ‘MLLE (More Love, Less Ego)’ tour!! Davido and I going on tour! save your coins! I no wan hear pim”. Reacting, Mr Jollof said it was not the best time for Wizkid to announce such as their fans have expected that over ten years ago. “Na now day break? @Wizkidayo. “You going on a tour at this point with Davido is not right. It seems like you are riding on his relevance. Reacting to the development, Wizkid posted a picture of his children with the caption on Snapchat, “Ladies, if your man is out here begging to feed you and your family, make sure he washes your pant, bra and plates because he is your house help. Meanwhile, the comment did not sit well with Mr Jollof as he described the relationship he has had with Wizkid as mutual and nothing more, questioning, “Have I begged you for money before?” Few hours after, he dropped another video shunning Wizkid to stop mentioning his family in a discussion because he is a responsible man who takes care of his home without depending on any one. “Wizkid has never done anything for me before. When he promised to give me money, he failed and doesn’t reply to my DM aftermath. “When I engaged my wife in Dubai, he didn’t do anything to assist me yet he comes out to call people poor. “I’ve helped his career more. To the world, Wizkid helped me but I helped him more. I promoted to become the super star he is now. “Wizkid is not a man,” he ranted.
