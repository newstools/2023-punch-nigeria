The Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, as part of his campaign to become Nigeria’s next President, made a visit to Biu Emirate, the southern part of Borno State. He was received by the southern Borno natives drawn from Chibok, Gwoza, Hawul, Askira Uba and the entire nine local government areas, where he promised to end insecurity. In his speech, Obi, in company of his running mate, Datti Baba-Ahmed, the Labour Party Chairman, Julius Abure, the governorship candidate,  Ibrahim Mshelia, and the coordinator of the event who is the Deputy National Campaign Manager, Isaac Balami, and other campaign stalwarts, promised to alleviate the sufferings and wipe the tears of the southern Borno people caused by the Boko Haram insurgents. Obi said, “I am one of you and feel your plight. I know that you are all hardworking and want to go back to your farms. I am giving you my word that this insecurity issue will be a thing of the past in my administration and I will ensure that my government gives you the best of life. Thank you for everything you have done for the country and I will never forget you. A new Nigeria is possible!” The governorship candidate of the party in the state, Mshelia, a native of Hawul LGA, Southern Borno, assured the crowd that if he is elected as governor and Obi as president, security would be restored and economic activities in the state would improve. He concluded that as a son of the soil, he would not disappoint the Borno people. The coordinator of the event, Isaac Balami, who doubles as the Obi-Datti’s deputy national campaign manager and the senior special adviser on presidential campaign matters, fundraising and grassroots mobilisation to the Labour Party chairman, said he was happy Nigerians were working hard to enthrone the Obi-Datti mandate.
