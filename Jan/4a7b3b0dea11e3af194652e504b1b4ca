Marvel Studios’ Black Panther ‘Wakanda Forever’ has smashed its box-office record by becoming the first film to reach N1 billion in Nigeria and Ghana since its release in November 2022. The distributor of blockbuster films in Nigeria and the Walt Disney Company Africa, FilmOne, announced this in a statement on Sunday. “We are ecstatic about the incredible response that Marvel Studios’ Black Panther – Wakanda Forever – has received at the box office,” said co-founders of FilmOne, Moses Babatope and Kene Okwuosa. “The follow-up to Ryan Coogler’s 2018 hit Black Panther has proven a draw for cinemagoers, captivating audiences across Nigeria, and we are honoured to have played a role in its success. The record-breaking performance of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is proof that the cinema industry in West Africa is not only alive and well but thriving,” they said. Director Ryan Coogler, along with Letitia Wright, Lupita Nyong’o, Danai Gurira, Winston Duke, Tenoch Mejía and local musicians featured in the film joined dignitaries and guests at the black carpet premiere event on November 6, 2022. The film was rated for its engaging plot, stunning visual effects, and talented cast. “Following on from the success of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, we are excited and committed to bringing more blockbuster films to our West African audiences, whilst supporting the growth of the cinema industry in the region. This is only the beginning of greater things to come,” adds Babatope. “We can’t wait to bring even more exciting and memorable films to audiences in West Africa and around the world,” the Senior Vice President and General Manager of The Walt Disney Company Africa, Christine Service, also said.
