Olawale Rasheed, the spokesperson for the Osun State Governor, Ademola Adeleke, has said his principal did not forge any certificate. Rasheed, in a statement obtained in Osogbo on Tuesday, said the clarification was necessary following a component of the judgement of the Osun Election Petitions Tribunal purporting forgery against Adeleke. He said the public should know that Adeleke did not forge his testimonial or any certificate, describing the claim as an attempt to damage the reputation of the governor. The statement read in part, “We seek to clarify a very sinister component of the Kangaroo judgement on Osun Governorship election. Governor Ademola Adeleke did not forge any certificate or testimonial. The issue  of forgery has to do with an error on school testimonial which bears Osun instead of Oyo State. Osun State was part of Oyo State when Governor Adeleke completed his high school education in 1981. “The issuing school testified before the Court of Appeal in 2018 that it was their error, which has nothing to do with Governor Adeleke. The Court of Appeal ruled that there was no forgery and exonerated Governor Adeleke of any forgery. “The public should know that Governor Adeleke did not forge this testimonial or any certificate. This was an attempt to damage the reputation of  Governor Adeleke. The tribunal chairman should explain how he arrived at his opinion when the Court of Appeal had cleared Governor Adeleke of any forgery.”
