Men of the Bauchi State Police Command have reportedly killed several bandits and kidnappers during a gun battle at the Yankari Game Reserve Forest in the Alkaleri Local Government Area of the state. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Ahmed Wakil, in a statement on Wednesday, said the command recovered two AK-47 rifles from the bandits. He said, “During the daring operation, several bandits were neutralised and dislodged from their enclaves, while the remaining sprinted in disarray into the deep forest with possible bullet wounds. “In the same vein, the troops sustained patrol and clearance operations around the thick forests to arrest the fleeing suspects. Consequently, two AK-47 rifles were recovered during the operation.” He added that operatives of the anti-kidnapping unit base 4 of the command arrested two suspects, who confessed to have kidnapped four people and camped them in the Yankari Game Reserve Forest and collected a ransom of N20m. “Investigation revealed that the principal suspect, Adamu Muhammad, confessed to having participated in kidnapping activities in Kaltanga Village, where they kidnapped four people and camped them at Yankari Forest for about five days until the sum of N20million was paid as ransom,” Wakil stated.
