Huawei Sub-Saharan African offices in Mozambique and Tanzania, have been recognised among the global top employers by Top Employer Institute. The firm rose from nine to 11 in the Top Employer rankings. The Huawei Southern Africa Region, Human Resources Director Yu Chen, disclosed this in a statement made available to The PUNCH on Monday. Chen said, “We are incredibly proud to have a growing number of Huawei offices across the Sub-Saharan region recognised as top employers, as well as to have seen improved rankings our rankings in several markets. “Mozambique and Tanzania now join South Africa, Zambia, Kenya, Nigeria, Angola, Ghana, Botswana, Mauritius, and Uganda with the Top Employer seal. Our South African office’s rise into the top 20 of Top Employers in the country is particularly noteworthy.” Chen also noted that the firm’s increased representation in the annual rankings is a testament to the work Huawei has put into employee well-being across the region over the past 12 months.
