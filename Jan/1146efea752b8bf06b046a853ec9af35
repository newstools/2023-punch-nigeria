The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, has described the All Progressive Congress as a party of deceit. He added that the APC deceived Nigerians to get re-election in 2019. Atiku, who stated this during the PDP presidential campaign rally in Minna on Saturday, said the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), deceived the people of Niger State to get their votes for his second term. “Someone came to you people in a hurry a few weeks to 2019 general elections and commissioned the Baro Port but since after that commissioning, not a single activity has happened there. “You people voted thinking the port will function and bring employment to the people, but now, you know better.” The former Vice President also said the APC government came with the slogan, ‘Change’, added that change came the negative way to the people in the country adding that they came with insecurity and hunger. The presidential candidate promised to reconstruct the roads and restructure the health systems should he emerge as president after the forthcoming election. Reacting, the spokesperson for the APC Presidential Campaign Council, Festus Keyamo describe Atiku’s statement as an insult to Nigerians. He said, “This is coming from a man who has never been trusted by Nigerians with their votes. Such statement is an insult to Nigerians. In 2019, 15 million Nigerians voted against him. “Nigerians know Atiku Abubakar very well. They know he cannot be trusted. That is why they keep rejecting him at the poll and they will reject him this time around. “Atiku cannot lie his way to power and with the recent exposition of the SPP saga, he has gone further away from the trust of Nigerians.”
