The South-West Peoples Democratic Party Youth Leader, Seyi Bamidele, on Tuesday, joined the chairmanship race of the party in Osun state. The osun chapter of the PDP is currently being managed by Dr. Adekunle Akindele in acting capacity after efforts to elect a substantive chairman for the party ended in a stalemate. Crises erupted in the party after the current South West PDP chairman, Soji Adagunodo, who, at the time was the incumbent chairman of the party in Osun was removed by the Uche Secondus-led National Working Committee and another member of the State Working Committee, Mr. Sunday Bisi, was named new chairman in an acting capacity. Bamidele, who had served as the PDP Youth Leader in Osun State, before he was elected South West officer of the party, submitted his letter of intent at the PDP state secretariat in Osogbo on Tuesday. Addressing newsmen shortly after making his intention known to the party, Bamidele said his ambition had the backing of prominent leaders of the party in the state. According to him, his age should be an advantage, having served at the state level before his current position as Regional Youth Leader of the party. He further said, “My intention to lead Osun PDP has the backing of prominent leaders of the party and I see myself as having enough experience to lead Osun PDP. “I was Osun PDP Youth Leader before I was elected South-West Youth Leader, the position I currently occupy. I have enough experience. “I am 39 years old and I believe my youthful age should be an advantage and not an impediment to me becoming the next Osun State Chairman of the party. My plan is to make the party stronger by involving more youth and women in the key decision-making processes. “Our elders will manage the party with their experience and wisdom through us, and we will leverage our youthful energy and drive to further deepen the root of PDP in Osun State.”
