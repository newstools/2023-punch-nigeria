The Presidency, on Monday, said former President Olusegun Obasanjo “lied” to the South-East electorate to garner votes during his tenure between 1999 and 2003. It said despite his promise to build a Second Niger Bridge, the former leader did not fulfil his promise. The Presidency said despite not garnering votes from the region, the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.)’s regime built the bridge believing it was the right thing to do. “Obasanjo lied to the South-East to get their votes. President Buhari didn’t get their votes but built the bridge because he believed it is the right thing to do,” a statement signed by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, read Monday evening. Shehu’s statement comes barely 24 hours after Obasanjo berated the Buhari regime, describing its tenure as “hell on earth” for Nigerians.
