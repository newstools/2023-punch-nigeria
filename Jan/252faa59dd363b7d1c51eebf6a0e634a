The Senate on Tuesday appealed to the Central Bank of Nigeria to extend the deadline for the exchange of old naira notes from the January 31 deadline to July 31, 2023. The apex bank had in October last year said the old naira notes would seize to be legal tender from January 31. The Senate in December passed a resolution urging the CBN to extend the deadline to June 30. However, the insistence of the CBN on no reversal on the set deadline instigated Senator Sadiq Umar, (APC, Kwara North) to move a motion on the floor of the Red Chamber on Tuesday where he demanded an extension to July 31. Most senators who contributed to the debate overwhelmingly embraced the extension, citing scarcity of new notes both in the banks and at the various Automated Teller Machine points across the country. The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, put the prayers in the motion to vote and the lawmakers voted in support of the extension of the deadline from January 31 to July 31.
