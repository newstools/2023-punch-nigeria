The Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has set up a committee to monitor fuel distribution and pricing following wide protests by people of the state. According to a statement by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Media Projects, Crusoe Osagie, the committee would constitute actors in the private sector, civil society organisations, and government to ensure that shylock marketers did not take advantage of the situation to rip Edo citizens off. The statement also said the State Government would hold a crucial meeting with all stakeholders in the product distribution value chain to deliberate on the issues responsible for distribution hurdles and price hikes, and find lasting solutions to the matters arising. While acknowledging the plight of the Edo people who have had to endure gruelling experiences accessing petroleum products as well as the exorbitant prices the product was sold for in the state in the last, the statement said the State Government was working with all stakeholders to nip the situation in the bud. Recall that The PUNCH had earlier reported tension in Benin as protests took place in different parts of the city over the hike in the petroleum pump price. The protesters barricaded various strategic places leading to the adjoining streets, while the police and Edo Security Network personnel manned various areas of the city. Most private schools also did not open on Monday as no one was sure what would happen. Noticeable among the protest groups was the Edo State Civil Society Organizations and the Faculty of Peace Organization. The protesters, who marched through Sapele Road to the Ring Road, chanted various solidarity songs and warned the various store owners who opened their stores for businesses not to open on Tuesday or face dire consequences.
