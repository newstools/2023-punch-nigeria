Edo State Government on Wednesday said only 20 persons were kidnapped in the last Friday train station abduction and not 32 as earlier reported. It said with the rescue of seven victims from the kidnappers’ den, only 13 persons are still in the custody of the abductors. The state Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, Chris Nekhihare, who stated this Wednesday, said the latest information was through intelligence. He said, “From intelligence report, the kidnappers only took 20 hostages as against 32 initially reported. “The state deputy governor, Philip Shaibu, has met with Igueben community leaders and heads of security agencies to assure residents of measures to check crime in the state. “The government is strengthening security to check crime and criminality. The Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration will make the state unsafe for kidnappers and other criminal elements to thrive.” He said the deputy governor was joined at the meeting by other top government officials, including the Senator representing Edo Central, Clifford Ordia; and the Speaker, Edo State House of Assembly, Marcus Onobun, where he called for calm among residents of Igueben Local Government Area, urged members of the public to provide useful information that will aid rescue efforts by security agencies. He stated that Shaibu informed the people of what the government is doing to give a morale boost to troops on the ground and also review the security strategy, warning the people of the consequences of harbouring terrorists in their domain. He said he urged monarchs within the area to sit up because if the government found out that they let out their facilities to be used by the kidnappers, such facilities will be seized.
