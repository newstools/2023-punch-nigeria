Liberian President, George Weah, has come out in full support of Morocco’s bid to host the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations after the hosting rights were withdrawn from Guinea over its lack of preparations. President Weah stated his position while reacting to ”false and misleading, reports making rounds in some international media outlets” that he was supporting the bid by Algeria to host the same tournament. He expressed his “fullest and strong” support for the Moroccan bid instead, which he has further emphasized to the Moroccan government. “Liberia fully endorses and supports Morocco’s bid to host CAF Nations Cup 2025. I have made this commitment to King Mohamed VI. It is cast in stone” he said in a statement seen by APA on Friday. Weah cited what he called the remarkable investments Morocco continues to put towards the development of football, which makes them deserve a chance to host the biggest African football fiesta. The former FIFA World Best Player said Morocco brought immense pride to Africa at the just-ended World Cup in Doha, Qatar and as such, Africa must honour them with the right to host the 2025 Nations Cup. President Weah said he has already begun campaigning for Morocco with football stakeholders around the continent. Morocco announced its bid after CAF stripped Guinea of its rights to host the tournament. Aside from neighbouring Algeria, other nations bidding to host the prestigious tournament are South Africa and Zambia. Nigeria and Benin are jointly bidding to host the competition in 2025.
