Akwa Ibom State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress has berated the Nsit Ubium chapter of the party for its purported suspension of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Umana Umana, from the party. The local chapter of the party, in a letter dated December 14, 2022, signed by the Secretary, Mr Monday John, and Chairman, Mr Johnson Udo had announced Umana’s suspension from the party for alleged anti-party activities. The local chapter accused Umana of surreptitiously working for the Peoples Democratic Party, to malign the APC in the state. The suspension letter read in part, “You are accused of sponsoring dubious cases in court against the official candidate of the party to weaken the party in favour of the Peoples Democratic Party governorship candidate, who is your friend and kinsman. “You are, to immediately contact or appear before the special committee set up to investigate this allegation and show cause why you should not be expelled from the party, failure of which, we shall be left with no option, but to invoke the law against you.” However, the state APC chairman, Mr Stephen Ntukekpo, reacting through a press statement, said the local chapter of the party was just seeking attention and called on the public to disregard the information, describing it as false and misleading. “I hereby state with unequivocal authority that the minister was never and has never been suspended from the party in his ward, chapter, or state,” he said.
