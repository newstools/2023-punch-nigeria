The Osun State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has cautioned the state Governor, Ademola Adeleke, on the use of thugs and propaganda in governing the state. The APC acting chairman, Tajudeen Lawal, in a statement obtained in Osogbo on Monday, accused Adeleke of “bringing large-scale insecurity to the state, adding that lives and property of the people were no longer safe.” Lawal also accused Adeleke of using thugs to oppress and suppress the opposition, noting that it would be counter-productive. He also noted that there was nothing to show that “Adeleke’s administration was ready to add value to the state as those who have been running the government for him are more interested in the instant monetary gains derivable from it instead of rendering selfless services that would be beneficial, on the long run, to the people of the state.” Reacting, Oladele Bamiji, a Senior Special Assistant (Media) to Osun State Governor, said the government was not in support of the act of criminality. He also said, “the state government is not unaware of the enormity of potential security challenge posed by remnants of armed groups instituted and nurtured by the past administration in the state, especially towards the July 16 2022 governorship election, which encouraged arms proliferation across the state. “These armed groups, who began and got emboldened with their formal recognition by the past APC administration as ‘state boys’ and got polarised in the course of frictions within the defeated government and the party, are a mere offshoot of that reckless government which the present administration is already collaborating with security operatives to get them disarmed and demobilised from such act within the ambit of the law and for the good of all and sundry.”
