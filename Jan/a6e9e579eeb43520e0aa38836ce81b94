The media of office of the lawmaker representing Osun East at the Senate, Senator Francis Fadahunsi, on Sunday, called for the arrest of those defacing the lawmaker’s campaign posters. Fadahunsi, who currently represents the Senatorial District, is seeking re-election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party. A statement signed by Sam Segun-Progress, on behalf of Fadahunsi media office, obtained in Osogbo on Sunday, alleged that supporters of Mr. Ajibola Famurewa, contesting the East Senatorial Seat on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, were behind the destruction of the campaign materials. It further read in parts, “We would have just ignored the miscreant Mr. Ajibola Famurewa parades around to get attention, because he is unpopular, hence his actions to use hoodlums to destroy campaign materials of another candidate. “But we want to urge Mr Famurewa to play the game according to the rules and not look for every available straw to hold on to. We will not tolerate him sponsoring violence against the good people of Osun East because of his ordained doom at the polls. We therefore call on security agents to call him to order so that the people won’t be forced to defend themselves.” But when contacted for a reaction, a member of Famurewa Campaign Organisation Media team, Mr. Isaac Olufemi, dismissed the allegation, saying those pasting posters of APC candidates were attacked by some security men attached to Fadahunsi. According to him, Famurewa had already petitioned the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, asking him to investigate some of his officers for the role played in the attack. He said it was stated in the petition details of the three security men working for Fadahunsi that carried out the attack at Imo Area of Ilesa on January 10, urging the IGP to conduct thorough investigation into the matter and punish the perpetrators.
