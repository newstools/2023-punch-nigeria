As part of measures to douse the tension being currently generated by the scarcity of new naira notes in circulation, the leadership of Sokoto Market Associations has agreed to adopt E-Naira transactions for their business. Speaking on behalf of the association, the chairman, Alhaji Yaro Gobirawa, said he would mobilise his members to key into the cashless policy so as to reduce money in circulation. Gobirawa, while speaking with newsmen shortly after meeting with Central Bank of Nigeria officials in the state on Wednesday, said his members were ready to embrace the E-Naira transaction as the way forward. Gobirawa, however, appealed to the CBN to advise commercial banks operating in the state to dedicate more staffs and desks to attend to its members. He further call on CBN management to ensure more new naira notes are in circulation to ease the pressure currently encountered by residents of the state. Speaking earlier, the Sokoto CBN Branch Controller, Dahiru Usman, commended the leadership of the market for its continuous cooperation with the bank. The controller further assured that the apex bank will dispatch some of its Information Technology staff to various points in the market in other to assist the traders in the development of the e-naira applications. He further disclosed that the CBN is introducing a swap of naira notes for residents from N10,000 and below. This, he said, would enable residents to ease the current pressure and stress being encountered by residents of the state as a result of the new naira notes.
