The Pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission to put all necessary machinery in place for the smooth conduct of the 2023 elections. In a statement by its national publicity secretary, Jare Ajayi, on Tuesday, the organisation said every effort must be made to ensure that the general election slated for February and March, respectively, not only hold successfully but that winners must emerge and sworn in on May 29, 2023, as stipulated by relevant laws. The PUNCH reports that Afenifere’s reaction came in the wake of the threat issued by the INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, that the seeming unabated insecurity may adversely affect the much-expected general election this year. Afenifere said, “But we feel that there is the need to let anyone thinking of postponement or cancellation of the elections that such a thing is and will remain unacceptable, no matter the reason. We recall that in 2015, there was insecurity too, to the extent that some local government areas, specifically in Borno State, were in the hands of Boko Haram terrorists. Yet elections were held. There was also insecurity in 2019 and elections were not stopped. “Afenifere felt the need to sound this note of warning so that whoever may be thinking of postponing or altering the election calendar should know that such a thing would not be accepted. “In Nigeria, there is often the tendency to fly a kite. Most of the times, such kites are on policies or steps that were usually not in the best interest of the Nigerian public. This is why it is very important to clearly sound this note of warning without any ambiguity. This is why we are stating clearly that Nigerians are prepared for the elections just as the whole world is awaiting the elections. Nothing whatsoever should alter the schedule or cause postponement let alone cancellation,” Ajayi stated.
