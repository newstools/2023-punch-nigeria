The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, has arrived in the United Kingdom alongside the party stalwarts for a meeting scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday with the British government. The PUNCH had earlier reported that Atiku’s Media Adviser, Mazi Paul Ibe, announced his UK trip in a tweet on Sunday, adding that it was on the British Government’s invitation. While discrediting an online report that he was transported to the UK for a medical check-up, his campaign spokesperson, Senator Dino Melaye, urged Nigerians to “disregard the lies of unrepentant liars. “Atiku is 100 per cent fit and in super form, health-wise. The British government invited the leading presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, just like that they had invited Bola Tinubu and Peter Obi earlier,” he added. In the photos that emerged, he was welcomed by Melaye, Timi Frank and other PDP members. See the photos below:
