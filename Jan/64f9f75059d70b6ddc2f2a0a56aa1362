Leaders of the All Progressives Congress in Ede, Osun State, have alleged that hoodlums working for the ruling Peoples Democratic Party burnt the APC secretariat in the Ede-South and also destroyed the party’s secretariat in the Ede-North Local Government Areas after the Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sacked the state governor, Ademola Adeleke. In a statement signed by Dr Mufutau Oyewale, and 26 other leaders of the APC in the two local government areas in Ede, obtained in Osogbo on Monday, the party also alleged that the PDP political hoodlums, who went on the rampage shortly after the delivery of the judgment on Friday, carried out their onslaught on the two APC secretariats located in Ede township. They alleged that during the attack, some members of the APC were injured. The statement partly read. “We enjoin the state Commissioner of Police and other sister security agencies in the state to come to the aid of the APC members and leaders in Ede who are being hunted by the PDP thugs like animals in the bush. We task the state Commissioner of Police to, without further delay, use the professional instrumentality of his office to investigate, arrest and prosecute the foot soldiers and the mastermind of the needless political attack on our members and property.” But while reacting, Osun PDP acting chairman, Dr Adekunle Akindele, said the party harboured no militia group, describing the allegation as a false alarm by the APC. Akindele said, “Osun PDP has no militia. We have no records of thuggery, unlike the APC that sponsored and nurtured thugs and bandits across Ede and Osun throughout its four years rule. Osun PDP members only engage in peaceful protests all over the state. Our members did not attack anybody. “The APC possibly deliberately staged fake attacks to raise a false flag.”
