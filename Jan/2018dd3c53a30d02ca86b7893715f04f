The Oyo State governor, Seyi Makinde, on Wednesday, promised residents of Lagelu Local Government Area that his administration will localise industries in the area if re-elected. The governor made the promise, according to a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Taiwo Adisa, while he addressed the traditional council of the local government in Lalupon, Ibadan. Makinde, who also met with the leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria, the League of Imams and Alfas and the traditional worshippers in Lagelu LG at different locations, reiterated that he will continue to be fair to all religious bodies. He said, “It is lamentable how notable industries such as the Nigerian Gas Cylinder, Exide Battery, Leyland, among others, have gone moribund in the LGA, therefore, there is the need to revive industrialisation in Lagelu. This will help to boost the state’s economy and this government will see to that under Omituntun 2.0. “I thank religious bodies for the support they have given me since this government started. I have noted all your requests and I can assure you that most of the issues will be sorted out, as we are also aware of them.” The governor also promised to approve the internal reformation of traditional institutions. In their remarks, the representatives of the traditional council, and religious and community leaders commended Makinde for his listening ear and they promise to work for the success of his second-term bid.
