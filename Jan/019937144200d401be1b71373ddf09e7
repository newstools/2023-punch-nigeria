Arsenal Manager, Mikel Arteta, has been nominated for the Premier League’s Manager of the Month award for January. It is the fourth time the Arsenal boss has been on the shortlist for the division’s monthly prize this term and is looking for his third success of the season after scooping August and November/December’s prizes. In a tough month that saw Arsenal boss go up against three teams vying for a place in the top four, we remained unbeaten – drawing 0-0 with Newcastle United before a memorable 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur in the north London derby. That was followed up by last weekend’s 3-2 success over Manchester United to restore our five-point lead at the top of the Premier League table. Arteta is up against Nottingham Forest’s Steve Cooper, who saw his team rise from 19th to 13th after claiming eight points from four games, as well as Roberto De Zerbi who saw his Brighton & Hove Albion side net nine goals in three matches. Unai Emery is another contender who picked up the most points in the month after guiding Aston Villa to 10 from a possible 12, while Brentford’s Thomas Frank is included after the Bees went unbeaten in their three matches.
