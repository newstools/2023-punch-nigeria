Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has ordered strippers and pole dancers to be sent to the front line in a move to cheer up his troops and boost morale. The move comes as the Kremlin announces a medal for all Russian soldiers which have deployed in what he calls the “special military operation”. According to ABCNews, the senior commanders have been ordered to organise the entertainment as Putin’s forces approach the first anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine. More than 100 girls will be ferried to the front in a fleet of helicopters for a series of “concert shows” at supply bases across the Donbas where troops are given five days of rest and recuperation. Crates of beer and Russian sausages will be shipped in for the troops and a ceremonial parade is expected on the 24th to mark the start of Russia’s operation and remember the fallen. News of the ‘raunchy stripping sessions’ was revealed on social media by a Russian officer who announced that troops would be getting a special surprise. In his post, the tank Colonel, codenamed ‘Armoured Death said, “Our heroes will be given special parties with pole dancing ladies, beer and food as a thank you for their service. “Events will be held as part of the soldiers’ rest period and aimed to raise the morale of troops who have been fighting in the front line.”
