The spokesperson for the Obi-Datti Campaign Organisation, Yinusa Tanko, has said the presidential candidate of the party in the 2023 polls, Mr Peter Obi, is enjoying the support of over 71 per cent of the youth population in the country. Tanko, who disclosed this in Osogbo, Osun State, ahead of the presidential rally of the party today (Saturday), said the LP  structure in Osun, which he said included the youth, artisans, Nigeria Labour Congress, Trade Union Congress and pensioners, were being mobilised for a victorious outing in the election. He also said the defection of a former Deputy Speaker for the House of Representatives, Mr Lasun Yusuf, would not affect the fortune of the party in the state. He said, “The structure we are talking about is the youth, artisans, NLC, TUC and pensioners. We have galvanised these structures for the battle ahead which is the 2023 general elections for Peter Obi. We are restructuring our party so that we can have a good outing in Osun. “The Peter Obi support groups are in large numbers in Osun State and over 71 per cent of Nigerian youths are behind him. We are not perturbed with anybody decamping. We are going to take the defectors too.” According to him, of all the presidential candidates, there were indications that Nigerians had absolute trust in only Obi, adding that the LP presidential candidate was the only candidate that would not ‘buy’ people or votes. “You can see the love expressed by youths and Nigerians who are spending their resources on his campaign. Obi has the capacity, character, consistency, compassion and commitment to nationhood. He has been able to make a mantra from consumption to production. He is the only governor that left N75bn in coffers of state government,” he added.
