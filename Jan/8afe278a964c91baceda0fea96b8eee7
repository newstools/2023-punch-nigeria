The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, has expressed worries over the latest attack on a train station in Igueben Local Government Area of Edo State during which an undetermined number of people were kidnapped by armed men. Atiku, in a statement press release signed by the Atiku Media Office on Sunday, noted that the misfortune “is the latest in a long condemnable line of security breaches previously unseen in our national history.” The presidential candidate, while condoling with victims of the attack and their families, said “The thoughts of my family and I are with the abducted and their families as we pray for their safe return.” He further stated, “It is important to also point out that this serves as the latest reminder on the urgent need to reform our security architecture to better safeguard the lives and properties of the Nigerian citizens.” Furthermore, the PDP presidential candidate advocated “applying diplomatic pressures needed to stem the free flow of light arms and assault weapons across the West African sub-region and through our borders. “By doing this, we will severely restrict the capacity for terrorists to re-arm themselves to execute attacks.” Atiku advised that these policy proposals should be followed by “greatly reducing the numbers of out-of-school children on our streets and improving the economy to create jobs for vast numbers of unemployed Nigerians, thereby reducing the pool from which these terrorists recruit people for their nefarious activities. “I believe these actions will go a long way towards reducing incidents of insecurity and providing the secure environment needed for economic growth.”
