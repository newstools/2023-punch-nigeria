No fewer than 84 directors under the Federal Ministry of Education have been deployed to unity schools across the country as members of staff. The directors deployed are within salary scale levels 13–16. In a circular issued by the Human Resource Management Department of the Ministry of Education, it was noted that principals and heads of administration of the unity schools will be requested to forward letters of compliance not later than January 20, 2023. An Assistant Director in the department, H.C. Okezie, signed the circular. The circular, which was tagged, “FME/S/1347/C.79/94,” was dated December 23, 2022, and it partly read, “I am directed to convey approval for the deployment of 84 education officers on salary grade levels 13–16 to the Federal Unity Colleges. “Principals/Heads of administrations are required to render returns on the level of compliance not later than January 20, 2023. “Kindly note that any disregard for these posting instructions shall be treated in accordance with PSR 030301(b).” The PUNCH reports that public service rule 030301(b) states that refusal to proceed on transfer or to accept posting is a form of misconduct which is inimical to the image of the service and that can be investigated and proved. It can also lead to termination and retirement.
