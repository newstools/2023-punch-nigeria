The Independent National Electoral Commission has said it is collaborating with the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Matters Commission and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to check vote-buying during the general elections. INEC described vote-buying was as a cankerworm that had eaten deep into the fabric of the nation, noting that it is also sensitising youths in various communities across the country to monitor and report anyone involved in the act during the elections. INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner in Rivers State, Johnson Sinikiem, stated this in Port Harcourt on Monday, during the opening ceremony of the 2023 Week of the Correspondents’ Chapel of the Nigeria Union of Journalists. The week is themed “Media Vigilance Ahead of Peaceful 2023 Election in Rivers State.” Represented by the Head, Voter Education and Publicity, Mark Usulo, he said with the new Electoral Act, anyone found with a permanent voter card that does not belong to him or her, risks jail term. Sinikiem further said the security agencies, especially the police and the Nigerian Security and Civil Defense Corps had been briefed to watch out for people in possession of PVCs that are not theirs. While charging the media to ensure accurate reportage of INEC activities before, during and after the elections, he said the electoral umpire would ensure free, fair, credible and violent-free poll. Sinikiem, however, commended the media on its efforts in informing the public about the elections as well as helping to disseminate the work of the commission, urging them to keep up the good work.
