The Economic Community of West African States has emphasised the need to partner INTERPOL to fight against money laundering and terrorism financing in West Africa. The ECOWAS Commissioner for Political Affairs, Peace and Security, Dr. Abdel-Fatau Musah, stated this when an INTERPOL delegation led by the Executive Director of Police Services, Stephen Kavanagh, visited him on Tuesday. In a statement made available to our correspondent on Thursday, Musah called for a win-win relationship and reciprocity between third parties and ECOWAS in joint efforts to combat transnational organised crime. Also, the Head of the West Africa Police Information System Programme, Richard Gotwe, indicated that the WAPIS project was in its operational phase at the national level, and more than half of the Member States had the system installed and operational. Gotwe also called for the strengthening of cooperation at the regional level for the full achievement of the projectâ€™s objectives. Kavanagh thanked the ECOWAS Commission for its efforts in the fight against cybercrime, counterterrorism, illegal migration in the region and praised the leadership of Musah in the WAPIS project.
