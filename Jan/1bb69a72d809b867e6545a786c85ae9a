The Labour Party Presidential Campaign Council has condemned the attack on its presidential candidate, Mr. Peter Obi, in Katsina on Tuesday. In a statement by the Head of Media of the Obi-Datti Presidential Campaign Council, Diran Onifade, the council flayed the attack and expressed optimism in the determination of the youth to take back their country. The statement read, “Our candidate had met with women in a town hall and then held a hugely successful rally at the Muhammad Dikko Stadium.  However, on his way to the airport, hoodlums attacked the car our candidate was riding in with heavy stones from his driver’s side causing substantial damage to the vehicle. “To the glory of God, Mr Obi and other occupants of the car were unhurt. “Subsequently, another set of thugs also threw stones outside the stadium which damaged several vehicles, including that of our official stage crew. “The two incidents taken together make us suspect that the attacks may have been premeditated at the behest of desperate politicians who had been deluding themselves with the false claim that they had the North West locked up but are now shocked by the show of force of the Obidient movement in the region. “While thanking the good people of Katsina who came out enmasse to support our campaign yesterday, we call on security agencies to investigate this matter to forestall future occurrences.” Obi was in Katsina on Tuesday in continuation of his presidential campaign ahead of the general elections
