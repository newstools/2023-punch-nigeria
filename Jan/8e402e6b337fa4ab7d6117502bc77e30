Accord party’s presidential candidate, Prof. Christopher Imumolen, has disclosed plans to appoint his cabinet members based on merit if elected Nigeria’s president during next month’s election. He said the move was in line with the principle of inclusiveness and that he would appoint capable hands from all regions of the country, according to a statement by his media office on Monday. According to him, the task of rebuilding a nation like Nigeria, battered by years of poor leadership and corruption, needed the input of all Nigerians, including those of his co-aspirants like Tinubu and Obi who are also vying for the coveted office. “The task of rebuilding our country is an onerous one. It is not going to be a one-man show. Everyone who has the idea and capacity to add value to governance, no matter their background or party affiliations, shall be called upon to do so. “For his adeptness and aptitude as a businessman of no mean standing, I will be appointing Peter Obi, the current Labour Party presidential candidate as my minister of trade and commerce, while Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu will serve as an adviser, most probably on the political front for obvious reasons. “You will agree with me that these men will most be suitable in the roles I have earlier mentioned because of their track records in both their private and public lives. “As I have said, the move is meant to demonstrate that we are all partners in progress in our desire to see our country regain its lost glory, as well as deliver to it’s millions of citizens the true dividends of democracy. “The move is also meant to send the message that appointments will only be given to those who merit it in the kind of reformist government we are planning to run. “The concept of square pegs in square holes shall be the guiding principles of our government under the umbrella of Accord — the party that preaches oneness and togetherness,” the statement read.
