Former president Olusegun Obasanjo on Monday embarked on an 18-kilometre walk around Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, as part of the centenary celebrations of the Baptist Boys High School. Obasanjo led current and old students of the school and was joined by the leadership of the Old Boys Association led by Prof. Kayode Oyesiku. The former President whose presence attracted a large number of admirers, dazzled the residents, motorists and passers-by during the walk. The Special Assistant to Obasanjo on Media, Kehinde Akinyemi, stated that hundreds of residents praised Obasanjo and echoed his name for his “prowess, energy, and endurance” to embark on the walk despite his age. Among those who played host to Obasanjo and his team were the Olu Ibara of Ibara, Oba Jacob Omolade, former Finance Minister, Onolapo Soleye, and the Alake of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Gbadebo. Obasanjo was also joined at the palace of Alake by some aged old schoolmates. They walked amid the singing of the school anthem among other songs, through Oke Egunya, Igbore, Oke-Igbein, and at the palace of Oba Omolade at Omida. Thereafter, they moved to the Ibara Housing Estate, the residence of Soleye. Shortly after the visit to Alake, the octogenarian headed towards Saje, the hosting community of the school. The journey took them through Isale Ake, Adatan, Kugba Road before entering the rehabilitated Saje Road into the school premises. Oyesiku said, “The walk covered an 18km stretch when added together”. He commended Obasanjo for his spirit behind the centenary anniversary exercise.
