A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress was said to have anonymously donated a two-storey building worth millions of naira as the secretariat for the South West Presidential Campaign Council of the presidential candidate of the party, Bola Tinubu. According to a statement issued on Thursday by APC Coordinator, Media and Publicity, Contact and Mobilisation, South-West Campaign Council, Kehinde Olaosebikan, the Director for Mobilisation in the zone, Alhaji Mutiu Are, was only contacted by the donor, who told him that he was supporting Tinubu’s presidential campaign purely because he believes Tinubu will run a government of peace, unity, and prosperity for all of Nigeria. The statement said Are thereafter led other campaign directors from the six states of the South-West on Wednesday to inspect and take possession of an edifice donated as a secretariat for the council. Olaosebikan said, “The directors were in Ibadan for a strategic brain-storming session of the Contact and Mobilisation Committee aimed at revving up the presidential campaign activities in the South-West. “Strategically located on the popular Obafemi Awolowo Way, Oke Bola, a few metres away from the residence of the late legendary leader, Obafemi Awolowo, the magnificent building has about 15 rooms for offices, waiting rooms, stores, a canteen, and parking space. “They expressed satisfaction with the quality, location, and suitability of the building, He was moved by the level of enthusiasm and commitment shown by the donor, who did not want to be named but was still evidently mobilising people across the country in support of the Tinubu-Shettima presidential ambition. “The building, which will serve as the Tinubu-Shettima Campaign’s South West Secretariat, will, according to the director, aid in the enhanced organisation and expansion of the campaign council’s activities, allowing it to interact more effectively with the myriads of support groups, associations, and volunteers who are daily indicating interest in Tinubu’s presidential bid.” The secretary of the committee, Wunmi Ohwovoriole, was equally pleased with the quality and symbolic location of the building, which is close to the house of the late Chief Awolowo, whom she described as the bastion of progressive politics in Nigeria.
