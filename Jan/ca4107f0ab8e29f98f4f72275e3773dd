The Nigeria Union of Journalists Special Delegates Conference session sitting in Kano on Thursday expunged the National Orientation Agency from its constitution. The special delegate session presided over by the unionâ€™s National President, Chris Isiguzo, took the decision during the constitution review session. All delegates agreed that NOA employees would no longer be granted the same rights as NUJ members. Also, NOA elected officials would be allowed to exhaust their terms of office. Similarly, the delegates made a new law barring members of staff of Ministries of Information adjudged to be non-practising journalists from being accorded NUJ membership. In addition, the delegates unanimously agreed that local government public relations officers would no longer enjoy NUJ membership status.
