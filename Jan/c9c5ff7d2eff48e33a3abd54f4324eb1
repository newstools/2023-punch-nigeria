The Independent National Electoral Commission’s Resident Electoral Commissioner in Osun State, Dr. Mutiu Agboke, has said the use of the Bimodal Voters Accreditation System for the 2023 polls would retire many fraudulent politicians. Agboke in an exclusive interview with The PUNCH on Thursday in Osogbo, also declared that BVAS was not only reliable but could not be manipulated through human influence. He also declared the readiness of the commission to conduct a credible election in the state, adding that security has been beefed up in all INEC’s local government offices across the state. Speaking further on BVAS, Agboke said, “BVAS is 101 percent reliable. There is no human influence or interference that can manipulate it. If anybody wants to do any fraud, then he would have to abandon BVAS and think of something else to do. “Manipulation can’t be done with it because you will use BVAS for both accreditation and transmission of results. Technically, the number of voters that are going to vote must be equal to the number of accredited voters. “Whoever is opposed to BVAS is a product of fraud and manipulation. Consistently, INEC has been saying that there is no going back on this BVAS issue because, in the few elections that have been conducted, BVAS has shown to us the pattern of voting and acceptability of the people. “Those who are products of fraud are likely to be retired by this BVAS because it guarantees certainty, ensures accuracy, and gives confidence to the reliability of results.”
