The Federal Government has accredited the Institute for Enterprise Management and Analytics as a conformity assessment body. According to a statement by IEMA, the accreditation issued by the Nigerian National Accreditation Service now authorises the institute to award ISO certification to organisations that have met the conformity requirement for certification. The Director-General of the institute, Raymond Smith, was quoted as saying, “A lot of companies in Nigeria with very good operating processes are not able to do business with international organisations due to standard compliance challenges.” As such, he said IEMA had been empowered by the Federal Government and positioned to help encourage and certify Nigerian companies that have met the rigorous criteria required for certification. He stressed that “to do a good business now in Nigeria, your company must have an ISO certification, which is the standard.” The Chairman of the Governing Council, Professor Ademola Ojo, was quoted as encouraging Nigerian companies to embrace standard certification by taking advantage of the IEMA accreditation to certify their processes and compete efficiently within and outside Nigeria. IEMA is one of the only three organisations accredited by the Federal Government and licensed by the Nigerian National Accreditation Service.
