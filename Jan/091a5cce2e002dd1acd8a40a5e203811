Ekiti State Governor, Biodun Oyebanji, has urged the Ekiti electorate to compensate the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, with votes for his immense contribution to the development of the state and mentoring of great politicians of Ekiti extraction. Oyebanji assured that if elected, “Tinubu will salvage the economy, restore the country’s lost glory, and bring about a new Nigeria that will work for the poor and the rich. For us in Ekiti, we have cause to vote for him for many things he has done for us, including mentoring great politicians from here.” The governor, represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Dr Habibat Adubiaro, who spoke on Sunday during a free medical services programme organised by a socio-political group, Team Better Naija, as part of efforts to promote Tinubu’s presidential bid, urged the people to take advantage of the medical outreach for improved health. The governor praised the group for the gesture, saying, “This life-changing medical initiative will help complement the present administration’s efforts in providing quality healthcare services to the people.” The group’s National Coordinator and former Commissioner for Works in Osun State, Remi Omowaiye, said, “The initiative is meant to assist the less-privileged who lack access to free and qualitative healthcare services.” Omowaiye said that no fewer than 1,000 indigents spanning different strata of society benefited from the free medical outreach, adding that free medical tests were offered and drugs were dispensed to the beneficiaries based on their health conditions. He urged the beneficiaries to get their Permanent Voters Cards and vote for Tinubu alongside his running mate, Kashim Shettima, in the February 25 general elections. The Team Better Naija Lead in Ekiti State and Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Special Duties, Olufemi Aduloju, described the free medical outreach as a huge success.
