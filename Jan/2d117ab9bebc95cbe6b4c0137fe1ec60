The All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, has congratulated the immediate past governor of Osun State, Gboyega Oyetola over his victory at the Osun State Election Petition Tribunal. A three-man tribunal chaired by Justice Tetsea Kume on Friday in Osogbo ruled that Oyetola was duly elected citing over voting as the basis for nullifying the election of Ademola Adeleke. In a congratulatory message to Oyetola signed by his media aide, Tunde Rahman, Tinubu described the ruling as a “triumph of courage, perseverance, and light over the forces of darkness that sought to arrest the progressive good governance the APC administration delivered to the people of Osun state under the leadership of Oyetola. “I heartily rejoice with Alhaji Adegboyega Oyetola on his much deserved victory at the Election Tribunal today. It is the victory of light over darkness. A triumph of perseverance, courage and justice over electoral fraud and democratic perversion. “The forces of darkness plotted to extinguish the able leadership and progressive good governance that improved the quality of life of our people under your leadership. But today, the Tribunal delivered justice and restored the mandate freely given to you and our great party. “I am confident that the good work you championed that was momentarily paused will soon resume and Osun people will be happy again. “And together we can renew their hope of a shared prosperity.”
