A police inspector, Yusuf Jafaru, has been killed during a gun duel that ensued between police officers and bandits along the Akwanga-Jos road in Nasarawa state. Our correspondent gathered that the incident which also led to the death of two bandits occurred on Wednesday night in Nunku town, Akwanga Local Government Area of the state. The gunmen in their numbers opened fire on five police officers who were on patrol in the area. The corpse of the deceased officer who was killed in the line of duty was deposited at the General Hospital, Akwanga while the corpses of the bandits were dumped at the police station in Akwanga town. Confirming the incident to our correspondent in Lafia on Friday, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Ramhan Nansel said, “What happened in Akwanga was that on January 4, 2023, at about 9 pm, our police personnel deployed to Akwanga-Jos road precisely around Nunku were attacked by some hoodlums. “They were, however, repelled by the police operatives. Two of the attackers were gunned down but unfortunately, one police inspector paid the supreme price. “Consequently, police personnel and re-enforcement were deployed to the scene by the Commissioner of Police, Maiyaki Baba, and we are working round the clock to track down the surviving hoodlums because as two of them were gunned down, others scampered into the forest with gunshot wounds.” While calling on members of the public to go about their lawful businesses without any fear, the PPRO appealed to residents of Akwanga, Nunku, and adjourning areas to be on the lookout for people nursing gunshot injury and report such persons to the nearest police station.
