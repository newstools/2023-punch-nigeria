The Bible Society of Nigeria on Friday held a fundraiser event towards the accomplishment of a new Bible House for the organisation. The event held at Shepherd Hill Baptist Church in Lagos and was graced by former President Olusegun Obasanjo, who served as the Chairman of the day; the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria, Daniel Okoh; CAN Lagos Chairman, Stephen Adegbite; Evangelist Esther Ajayi, amongst others. In his opening speech, Obasanjo urged Christians to ensure they donate towards providing a better building for the BSN to keep the word of God going. The former President lamented that the current building that served as the BSN’s office was not befitting of the Christian organisation. “If the office of the Bible Society of Nigeria is as poor as the worst place, then we need a new and respectable building fitting the society,” he said. On his part, the CAN President, who also stressed the need for a new building for the BSN, expressed the believe that the gathering will see to the need. “I want to thank the Almighty God for making it possible, for granting us God health and traveling mercies to be able to converge in this place to do this fund raising so that we take away the shame of the Nigerian Christians. I believe that this gathering will be the beginning of new possibilities to happen to us as Nigerian Christians,” Okoh said. During the programme, Obasanjo acknowledged the donations made by different organisations and called for more for the realisation of the project.On her part, Evangelist Ajayi promised to send an engineer to inspect the site for the building so as to ascertain the level of contribution to make. Giving his vote of thanks, the BSN President and Board Chairman, Bishop Timothy Banwo, appreciated the audience and guests at the fundraiser, adding that the BSN couldn’t be more grateful.
