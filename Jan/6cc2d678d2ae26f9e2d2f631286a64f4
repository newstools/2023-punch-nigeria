The All Progressives Congress has disclosed the reasons why Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo and some other stakeholders in the party are not involved in the campaign of the party’s presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. Since the APC flagged off its presidential campaign in Jos on November 15, 2022, some members of the party, including the Vice President have not been seen campaigning for their party’s candidate. Osinbajo, who has been seen attending other social activities, including the recently held centenary celebration of the Baptist Boys High School in Abeokuta, had been silent on Tinubu’s campaign since he lost at the party’s primary election. Even on social media where the VP has a strong base and posts all his major activities, he has never posted any material to show his support for Tinubu’s candidacy. Similarly, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, has also been absent from the campaign train of his party. Reacting, the APC Presidential Campaign Council spokesman, Festus Keyamo, said, the Vice President was acting on the directive of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to concentrate on governance. He said, “Rotimi Amaechi (former Minister of Transportation) was there in Adamawa State and Jos recently; he has been going to the rallies but he has picked the ones he wants to attend. “For the Vice President, it was a directive for him to face governance, and you can see Mr President has been going round campaigning. Also, Ngige is not campaigning against our party, he just said he will remain neutral for his own reasons and that is just one minister out of 43. “We have an absolutely strong coalition in the APC unlike the PDP that has virtually collapsed.”
