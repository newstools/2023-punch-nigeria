This informs our numerous corporate social responsibility interventions across the country where we work to ensure the standard of living of the communities are improved. “For us, CSR goes beyond philanthropy to also include sustainability as we aim to empower the next generation to take on the challenges and opportunities that may come their way. What better way to do this than to help them study in a conducive environment? “That is why we are donating learning materials ranging from school uniforms to classroom desks to the Asmau Dambatta Foundation today.” According to the statement, the donated items include 1,500 pieces of female uniforms, 1,500 pieces of hijabs, 1,000 pieces of male uniforms, 5,000 pieces of 60 leaves notebooks and 100 double seater desks. A trustee of the foundation, Alhaji Balarabe Bala, while receiving the educational materials expressed his gratitude to the bank’s management and assured the guests that the materials would be used judiciously, especially by the indigent students and community schools who were in dire need of such items.
