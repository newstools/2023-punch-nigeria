Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has described the dissolution of the Ekiti State Executive Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party by the  Iyorchia Ayu-led National Working Committee of the party as an act of tyranny. The governor said the dissolution would be challenged in court. Wike, who dared the PDP National Chairman (Ayu) to suspend him or any of the G-5 governors, warned that the resort to despotism by the NWC would not do the PDP any good in the forthcoming general elections. Wike stated this while speaking at the campaign flag-off rally by the State PDP Campaign Council in Bori, Khana Local Government Area on Saturday. He stressed that the dissolution of the Ekiti State working committee would be challenged in court because there are still members of the PDP who believe in the rule of law and that the party should respect its constitution. The governor stated, “Let me also use this opportunity to say to Iyorchia Ayu and his team; your dissolving Ekiti State Exco will not help you in anyway. “Your suspending people will not help you in anyway. The battle line has been fully drawn. As I speak to you, we will do everything legally possible to challenge any decision we know is illegal.”
