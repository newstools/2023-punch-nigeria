The Lagos State Chapter of the All Progressive Congress has said that the absence of Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo in Asiwaju Bola Tinubu’s will not have any effect on the party. It said the party was not structured around individuals, adding that victory would be delivered for the party at the 2023 poll even without his participation in the party’s campaign. Sunday PUNCH had earlier reported that some members of the party, including the VP had been aloof with the campaign activities of their party since they lost to Tinubu at the Presidential Primaries. Although the APC Presidential Campaign Council spokesman, Festus Keyamo, had said the Vice President was acting on the directive of the President to concentrate on governance, there are concerns that the VP would have been active in the campaign if he had emerged as the APC presidential candidate. Speaking in an interview with our correspondent, the APC spokesperson in Lagos State, Seyi Oladejo, said the absence of the VP would not affect Tinubu’s victory at the poll. “We are not bothered; we have an enduring structure to deliver for the election. Remember we have never lost the state since the advent of this democracy and everything points to our victory,” he said.
