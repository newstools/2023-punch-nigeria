The Imo State Government has revealed its plans to boost economy in the state using tourism. Speaking during a Saturday webinar, titled ‘Opportunities in tourism in Imo State,’ organised by the Chief Economic Adviser to the state government, Prof Kenneth Amaeshi, the state Commissioner for Tourism, Jerry Egemba, reiterated the commitment of the government to tourism development in the state and its openness to welcome investors in the sector. Egemba said, “Imo has been known over time as a tourism centre.” He spoke about how hotel businesses had been developed with tourism boosting the hospitality sector in the state, and how further investments in the sector would bring employment opportunities to youths among other residents. According to him, I have never seen a government more committed to tourism than the present administration of Governor Hope Uzodimma. “Talking about investment, we want to turn the Nworie River into a tourism centre, and that is ongoing,” he said. The commissioner envisaged a situation whereby a lot of Imo indigenes would be coming home to see interesting tourist centres as he noted it was already happening. Also speaking, one of the panelists, Osiagwu Chikezie, identified “attraction, activities, amenities, accommodation and accessibility” as important components to boost tourism. Another key component identified during the webinar is transportation, being a complementary factor to tourism, as it determines both accessibility and employment opportunity. Other panelists at the programme were: Head, Branding and Standardisation, Corporate Affairs, Niger Delta Development Commission, Clara Braide; General Manager, Uchemec Group of Companies, Owerri branch, Igbo Queen, and Chief Executive Officer, Creative Niger Radio, Frank Meke;
