Former President Goodluck Jonathan will on Monday, January 16, 2023, inaugurate the 1.15km Afi- Uko Ntighe bridge project, said to be the longest bridge in Akwa Ibom. The bridge executed by Governor Udom Emmanuel in Mbo Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State has been described as the fourth longest in Nigeria. Conducting newsmen round the bridge on Friday, the Special Assistant to Governor Emmanuel on Research and Documentation, Essien Ndueso, said the bridge was part of a 19km road constructed from Mbo LGA to Etebi in Esit Eket LGA. Essien also said the bridge was among over 40 bridges constructed by Emmanuel across the 31 local government areas in the state as part of the Completion Agenda of his administration. He said the Afi- Uko Ntighe bridge was initiated by former governor Godswill Akpabio’s administration but later abandoned in 2014. “This bridge as you all know was initiated by the former Governor Godswill Akpabio in 2008. Since then, it has been a sad story of neglect and poor contractual disposition to agreements,” Essien said. He added, “The bridge was only 35 percent executed when Governor Udom Emmanuel took over office in 2015. The governor in 2018 had to get a contractor that specializes in Bridge construction – AMITEC. “Now, this project is completed. Former president Goodluck Jonathan will commission this bridge on Monday 16 January 2023”. He stated that the bridge had both social and economic impacts on residents of the area as they would carry their goods which were mainly seafoods to different parts of the state. The governor’s aide, flanked by his colleagues, Aniefiok Macauley and Engr. Solomon Eyo, said that Emmanuel refused to play politics with projects, hence his decision to complete the project. “In other climes, Governors declare public holidays to commission mere 1km roads, but here Governor Emmanuel has silently completed a bridge as long as this, on a 19km road,” Essien said.
