The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, has promised to create jobs for the teeming unemployed youths if voted as president in the forthcoming General Elections. He made the promise to the mammoth crowd of supporters during his campaign rally at the UJ Esuene Stadium, Calabar on Tuesday. He also promised to make Nigeria prosperous, adding that, “Our economy is unhelpfully designed to export raw materials and import increasingly expensive finished products. “Crude oil still provides most of our foreign exchange and agriculture has traditionally been the backbone of this nation and will continue to be. “However, we must acknowledge the growing importance of our urban population which exceeds 50 per cent, about 100m people under our government. “Our cities and towns will witness a level of industrial activity unprecedented in our nation’s history. “Youths shall become the leading catalyst driving economic resurgence. The allocation of revenue between federal and state governments will be adjusted to give states greater flexibility to foster grassroots economic development. “Our government will give priority to encouraging industries vital to national development by growing our industrial base to provide jobs to an expanding urban population.” Tinubu also promised to develop the state’s tourism and turn the waterfront to beautiful city. The state governor, Prof. Ben Ayade, and other party leaders canvassed votes for Tinubu and were unanimous that he would develop the deep seaport and the super highway if he becomes president.
