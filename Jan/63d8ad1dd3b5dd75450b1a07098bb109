Nigerian singer, Olawale Olofooro, better known as Brymo, has insisted that he was not sorry over his comments regarding the possibility of an easterner becoming president of the country. The singer had come under fire for stating that an Igbo presidency would only be a “pipe dream” due to the agitation for Biafra. “As long as there (are) talks by prominent people from Igboland about Biafra, an Igbo presidency will be a pipe dream,” Brymo tweeted. The singer, a supporter of the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, also stated that it was not “prudent’ to vote for the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, an Igbo man. Commenting on a tweet supporting Obi, Brymo said, “It is not prudent to elect him yet. He may have to vividly organise his home front to lead rest of us. An Igbo VP first maybe to test the waters with the region is safer!” His comments, however, sparked negative reactions from tweeps who tagged him as a tribal bigot and being “Igbophobic”. Reacting to the knocks. Brymo tweeted on Friday, “Dear easterners, I’m not sorry.” The tweet brought further knocks from the singer’s critics, as they accused him of bringing disunity among different tribes. A tweep, @Chikezieengr, said, “Brymo is such a disappointment. An ethnic bigot, licking the feet of @officialABAT for a few coins. People like him are the reason for the division in Nigeria.” Another critic, @Buchyogba, tweeted, “Brymo is depressed. Those around him should show him some love and care.”
