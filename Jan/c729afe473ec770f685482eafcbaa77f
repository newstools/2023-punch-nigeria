…let bygones be bygones, says Abdulsalami The presidential candidate of the African Action Congress, Omoyele Sowore, has said he cannot politically agree with his counterpart in the Action Alliance and former Chief Security Officer to late General Sani Abacha, Major Hamza Al-Mustapha (retd.). Sowore said his disagreement with Al-Mustapha is political, saying it came from the military era, especially as it related to the June 12, 1993 saga, during which the election of Moshood Abiola was annulled under the regime of Abacha. He said this during another round of peace meeting of all the presidential candidates in Abuja on Friday. The National Peace Committee is headed by former Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar (retd.), whom Sowore said he could not also agree with, as Abdulsalami was also in the military. Abdulsalami, a retired Army General, served as the Head of State from 1998 to 1999. He was also Chief of Defence Staff between 1997 and 1998. He succeeded Abacha upon his death. “I was asked by the Chairman of the National Peace Committee, General Abubakar Abdulsalami to “reconcile” with Major Hamza Al-Mustapha. I was very clear that my disagreement was political, that I have issues with all the military people that annulled the June 12, 1993 elections including him (Abdulsalami)!” Sowore said. Reacting during the event, in a video obtained by our correspondent, Abdulsalami said, “I think you (Sowore) carry so many ideas. By the time you become the President of this country, some of us will leave this country.” Abdulsalami thereby pleaded with Sowore to “let bygones be bygones. “
