A former Senator, Segun Baju, has said the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, will play a role in the emergence of the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, in the forthcoming election. He disclosed this in a statement made available to journalists on Saturday, adding that any call made for Ayu to step down would be a wrong decision. The statement partly read, “The deft management of the party by Dr Iyorchia Ayu since being elected as chairman in October 2021 has set in motion a chain of reaction that will culminate in the election of the party’s flag bearer, Atiku Abubakar, as Nigerian president in early 2023. “All party faithful must mobilise across the country as Nigerians are determined to replace the current government that has brought misery and calamity to millions of Nigerians. Since 2015, every economic and social indicator has been, negative and Nigerians have continued to wallow in abject poverty, insecurity, and social disruption to daily life. “Any call for Dr lyorchia Ayu to step down as chairman is a step in the wrong direction. You do not change a winning team in the midst of a battle. Iyorchia Ayu is set to redeem the PDP and rescue Nigeria from retrogression. Once the PDP Federal government is installed in Abuja 2023, Dr Ayu will do the right thing.”
