The All Progressives Congress governorship aspirant, Professor Terhemba Shija on whose case the appellate court ordered fresh primary in Benue State has promised to proceed to Supreme Court. In a statement issued by the director general of his campaign, James Mbachiantim, said after  due consultations with stakeholders and his  lawyers, he has  decided to appeal against the judgement of the Court of Appeal delivered on Monday, 23rd January, 2023. The three man panel of appeal court judges had  ordered fresh primary in 11 of the 23 local government areas of the state within 14 days. Shija explained that the judgement threw up certain legal issues that could only be resolved by the highest court in the land. “For instance, since the court accepted our submission and held that there was no All Progressives Congress governorship primary election in Benue State for the 2023 polls at the first instance, how could there have been any basis or legitimacy for a rerun? “The resolution of the foregoing and several other issues has compelled us to approach the Supreme Court. “We appeal to APC members and the entire Benue electorate for calm and understanding that the judicial process is part and parcel of democracy,” Shija said in the statement.
