The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, on Wednesday, held a closed-door meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Most Revd Justin Welby, in the United Kingdom. The development is coming barely two days after Atiku met with some UK ministers. The PUNCH had reported on Tuesday that Atiku met with the UK’s Minister for Development and Africa in the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, Andrew Mitchell, among other key senior UK government officials, where the PDP’s presidential candidate solicited their support in helping Nigeria recover every facet of its life. Atiku, who confirmed his meeting with Welby, posted a picture of himself and the Archbishop on his Facebook page on Wednesday. According to the former VP, they had a meaningful deliberation on shared beliefs that was aimed at promoting better humanity. He wrote “The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Revd Justin Welby, is an amiable personality. My meeting with him, which ended not long ago, dwelled on shared beliefs in promoting better humanity and ensuring that the lot of the common man is improved.”
