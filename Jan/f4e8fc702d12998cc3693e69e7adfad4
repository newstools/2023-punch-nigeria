The presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party, Rabiu Kwankwaso, has promised that the success recorded in Kano when he was the governor will be replicated in Nigeria if elected president. Kwankwaso stated this in Abuja on Monday, during the second presidential town hall meeting organised by the Department of Political Science of the University of Abuja. He lamented that Nigeria is facing a serious crisis in the education sector, from primary to tertiary education levels, noting that the All Progressive Congress and Peoples Democratic Party have failed Nigerians. “I am very happy that Nigerians have an alternative to the failure of All Progressives Congress and Peoples Democratic Party,” he said. He noted that the issue of education is critical, and his administration will address it squarely. “In our manifesto, we said once you pass JAMB, it will stay for four years. You don’t need to go and sit for that examination again because we believe government must take responsibility to ensure that sons and daughters of the poor are all given equal opportunities to go to university. “So, our own belief is education, education and education,” he added. The Vice Chancellor of UNIABUJA, Prof Abdul-Rasheed Na’Allah, enjoined all the presidential candidates to come and speak to Nigerians about why they want to rule the country. He lamented that despite the abundance of mineral resources in Nigeria, the country is still battling with issues such as irregular electricity, and a poor healthcare system while roads are death trapped.
