The Governor of Borno State, Prof Babagana Zulum, on Friday, said the people of the state would vote like other Nigerians nationwide on election day without fear of attacks. He premised this on the relative stability of Borno, saying security had improved 90-fold since 2011. Zulum made this claim when he briefed State House correspondents shortly after a closed-door meeting with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at the Aso Rock Villa, Abuja. According to him, efforts are underway to fully rehabilitate and resettle all internally displaced persons in the state. While arguing that there are no regions free from security challenges, he said the Borno State Government had received support from the Federal Government and the military. Asked if Borno citizens would freely participate in the February/March elections, Zulum said, “The people of Borno State voted during the 2015 elections. They have also voted during the 2019 elections. “Can you compare the security situation in 2019, 2011 and now? The security in Borno has improved tremendously by over 90%. So we don’t have any problem. “Eligible voters can go and cast their votes on election day, Insha Allah, in Borno State, we don’t have any problem.”
