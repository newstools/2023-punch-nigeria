Some political parties have expressed worry over their inability to upload the details of their agents on the portal of the Independent National Electoral Commission ahead of the 2023 general elections. Some of them who spoke to our correspondent explained that the challenge was due to the newness of the innovation unlike in the past when INEC did it on their behalf. The Africa Democratic Congress said that in the process it incurred costs to upload the names, and pictures of its agents on the portal despite having enough manpower at its disposal. Commenting further the party pointed out that the innovation which was new to its members required some time to have a grasp of it, especially for the parties at the local and state levels. The ADC National Chairman, Ralph Nwosu, said, â€œWe have challenges; this will be the first time political parties have to do the entries by themselves. You know in other elections you get names, get pictures to submit to INEC at the state and national levels but this time, INEC wants parties to enter the names of their agents, pictures and so on.
