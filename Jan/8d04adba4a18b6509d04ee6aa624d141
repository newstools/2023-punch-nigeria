The World Health Organisation reported 674,678 new COVID-19 infections from January 23 to January 25, 2023, The PUNCH reports. The data obtained from the WHO’s COVID-19 dashboard showed that 3,584 people died from the infection during the period under review. This is just as the global health body noted that COVID-19 vaccination remains critical in protecting against severe illness and death, as the virus remains in circulation and continues to mutate. The Director General of the WHO, Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, had expressed worry over the rising number of COVID-19 deaths in many countries. Ghebreyesus said the Emergency Committee on COVID-19 would meet this week to discuss whether the current situation still constituted a global emergency. The report from the UN body revealed that 396,821 COVID-19 confirmed cases were reported on January 23, with 2,142 deaths. On January 24, no fewer than 98,748 confirmed cases were recorded with 729 deaths. While 179,108 cases and 713 deaths were reported on January 25. As of January 25, 2023, there have been 664,873,023 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 6,724,248 deaths, reported to the WHO. In a related development, the WHO Regional Office for Africa in Brazzaville said Africa is emerging from the New Year travel season without a significant upsurge in COVID-19 for the first time since the start of the pandemic. It, however, said the drop in reported new cases may be partially due to low COVID-19 testing rates, but of critical importance is that hospitalisation for severe illness, as well as deaths, have reduced significantly.
