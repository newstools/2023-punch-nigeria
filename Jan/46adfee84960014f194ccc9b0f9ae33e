The Delta State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party says the All Progressives Congress has failed especially in its 16 campaign promises to Nigerians in 2015. The Director, Delta State Campaign Council, Funkekeme Solomon, who stated this on Wednesday in Asaba, the state capital, said PDP over the years won elections in the state. He said, “When APC was coming to power in 2015, they gave us over 16 promises and till date, none has been fulfilled. Rather, it went worse. “They promised to reduce fuel pump price to N45 per liter in the first year of their administration, free education at all levels, placing every graduate on allowances after their youth service until they find a job. “They also promised  to expand electricity generation to 40,000 megawatts, stabilize global oil prices at $100 per barrel, stop importation of refined petroleum products, all refineries will be working at 100 percent full capacity among others. “All these campaign promises including crushing Boko Haram and insurgency in the first three months in office and bringing back all missing girls in their captivity have not been fulfilled. “Therefore, we have gone round 23 local governments out of 25 local governments in the state and the people have agreed to vote PDP because the APC government is a fraud. “Deltans has been favour as VP candidate in the history of Nigeria and Okowa as a president will put an end to non attention of federal to the state development.” On defection of PDP members to APC recently, Solomon said both parties are receiving candidates at this critical time of electioneering even as he noted that PDP is receiving more and the party is intact to win the 2023 election. He cleared the rumors going round the state that former governor James Ibori boycotted the party campaign rallies, saying, “Ibori never snubbed the party rally. He is busy with national assignments.”
