The Christian Association of Nigeria on Saturday called on the Federal Government to improve the security framework of the country to stop the unprovoked killing of citizens. The organisation was reacting to the murder of the Parish Priest of Ss Peter and Paul Catholic Church, Kafin-Koro, in Paikoro Local Government Area of Niger State, Rev Fr Isaac Achi, by suspected terrorists. The President of CAN, Archbishop Daniel Okoh, in a statement issued in Abuja, said, “Fr Achi, who was buried on Friday, has earned his place as a committed servant of God and minister of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ on account of the high standards of ethics and devotion with which he discharged his responsibilities as a religious leader. “His death is a sad development at a time for his parishioners and by extension, other Christians in the country can benefit more from his leadership and sense of direction. “It is a big loss to the Church in which he played major roles as priest, guardian and philanthropist to many needy members of our society. Because of these impeccable records, he lives in our hearts. His indelible footprints tell us that he will always be part of the journey of many believers in Nigeria and the world at large. “As we condole with the entire Catholic Church at this moment of grief, CAN appeals to the authorities to improve our internal and external security framework to stop future occurrences of such incidents that led to Fr Achi’s sudden demise. May his soul rest in perfect peace, Amen!”
