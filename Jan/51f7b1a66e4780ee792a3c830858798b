Pope Francis has called for prayers for the soul of a Nigerian priest who was murdered last Sunday. He also seeks prayers for the suffering people of Ukraine. At the General Audience on Wednesday, Pope Francis asked the audience to remember in their prayers the many Christians who suffer violence directly. According to Vatican News, the pope spoke in particular about Father Isaac Achi of the Diocese of Minna in northern Nigeria, who was murdered last Sunday in his parish residence. Bandits targeted the Fr. Achi and assistant parish priest, Fr. Collins Omeh, at the residence of the Church of St. Peter and Paul, in Kafin-Koro, in the Paikoro region. The unidentified assailants set fire to the residence, burning Fr. Achi alive, and shot and injured Fr. Omeh as he attempted to escape. The bandits were said to have invaded the community at about 1 am and began shooting sporadically while heading to the uphill residence of the Rev. Father, The PUNCH reports. The Pope then turned his thoughts to “battered Ukraine”, calling on everyone to remember the people in their prayers as they greatly need “our closeness, consolation, and above all peace,” according to Vatican News. He also spoke on the latest missile attack that took place last Saturday killing and injuring many civilians, among them children. “The images and the testimonies of this tragic episode are a powerful appeal to our consciences. No one can remain indifferent!” the Pope said. Forty-five persons reportedly died and 79 injured in a Russian missile strike that hit an apartment building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Saturday. 19 are still missing.
