A group known as Pan Nigerian President of Igbo Extraction Coalition has warned the Indigenous People of Biafra and its factions that multiple sit-at-home orders could deprive the Igbo winning 2023 presidency. This is contained in a statement jointly signed on Friday by the group’s Chairman, Rev Obinna Akukwe and the Secretary, Dr Pat Anyanwu. According to PANPIEC, frustrated politicians would use the purported sit-at-home of February 24 to scuttle the aspirations for Igbo presidency and give the impression that the South-East voters were supporting the agitation for a Biafra state. “PANPIEC is aware that some members of the Strategy Team are working behind the scenes for the release of Nnamdi KANU, details of which will be kept private. “Therefore, any further multiple sit-at-home represents a multiple demarketing of the Igbo Presidency Project. “PANPIEC advises Simon Ekpa, Commander of IPOB auto-pilot, to jettison his Biafra agitations till after the 2023 elections to enable teeming Igbo Youth to exercise their civic responsibilities. “Igbo cannot be asking for Biafra and Igbo Presidency simultaneously. “PANPIEC warns for the last time that the indiscriminate sit-at-home strikes fear into the minds of other stakeholders in the north favourably disposed to the Igbo Presidency. “PANPIEC have received thousands of inquiries from concerned northern voters over the stance of Ndigbo on Biafra and warns that all the rumours of war are destabilizing the Igbo Presidency Project”, the group stated.
