The Lagos State Government has highlighted the importance of households and workplaces having fully equipped first aid kits in a bid to reduce mortalities from accidents and emergencies. The state Commissioner for Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, Mrs Cecilia Dada, said this, according to a statement on Wednesday, during a one-day capacity-building workshop for women-focused Non-Governmental Organisations, held in Agege. Dada, who was represented by the ministry’s Director, NGO Unit, Mrs Itunu Babarinde, explained that women and girls are often the most affected in emergency cases, hence the need to leverage their potential to manage incidents. She said, “This training will equip participants with skills and knowledge of how to perform basic first aid in emergencies such as fire outbreaks, traumatic injuries, environmental injury and illnesses, animal bites, insect stings, adult Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation/choking, child and infant CPR/choking, amongst other unforeseen occurrences. “In addition to knowing some basic first aid techniques, it is also important that households and workplaces have first aid kits that meet their needs and are well organised, fully stocked and readily available at all times. “It is also smart to include a list of your healthcare providers, like the Lagos State Emergency response numbers 767 or 112, and prescribed medications in your first aid kits.” In her presentation, a specialist, Mrs Aduragbemi Esther, said, “You must understand that the decision to act appropriately with first aid can mean the difference between life and death.” On his part, a facilitator, Mr Damilola Adeyemo, advised participants to go for regular medical check-ups, adopt a balanced diet, and exercise regularly.
