The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, on Monday took his campaign to Katsina State where he promised to tackle hunger, insecurity and unemployment among others. He spoke while addressing party members and supporters at the Muhammed Dikko Stadium, Katsina. Obi and his campaign team, including his running mate, Datti Baba- Ahmed, told the crowd that they were ready to serve the country with all the strength in them if elected. He promised to fulfil all his promises to Nigerians, insisting that electorates should have faith in him and his party to further develop the country. He said, “People, through us, have chosen to build a new Nigeria. When we have security, we shall open our borders. Ours is to sack poverty in Nigeria. We cannot fight poverty without opening our borders but we shall put in place adequate security first. “We know you have always been deceived by the people you voted for in the past. We in the Labour Party will not deceive you. We appeal to you to vote for us and I assure you, we will not deceive you. “We shall fight hunger; we shall fight poverty and we shall ensure that there is security in Katsina and all parts of the country. “We however appeal to you to please vote for us to deliver all the good things we have for you. We assure you of our commitment if you vote for us.” Obi and his campaign team later left the stadium for a town hall meeting with party leaders and members in the state.
