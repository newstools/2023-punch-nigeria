The Osun State Governor, Ademola Adeleke, has called on voters in the Osun East Senatorial District to support all candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party in the 2023 general election. Adeleke, who spoke in Ilesa on Wednesday at the re-election campaign flag-off for Francis Fadahunsi, the current lawmaker representing Osun East in the Senate, also said the presidential candidate of the party, Atiku Abubakar, had promised to ease the current debt profile of the state, if elected president. He commended the people of the senatorial district for supporting him in the July 16 governorship poll, and promised to show his gratitude through projects that would be implemented in the area. He said, “You need to vote for all PDP candidates because these are the people that will work with me. “Atiku has whispered to me that he will help us to ease the N402billon debt portfolio left for the state by the APC government.” In his remarks after receiving the PDP flag from the governor, Fadahunsi urged voters in the area not to entertain fear but to come out and vote for all PDP candidates in the general election.
