The available generation capacity in Nigeria’s power sector dropped again in 2022, as it crashed from the 6,336.52 megawatts recorded in 2021 to 5,346.82MW last year, latest data on electricity generation trend seen in Abuja on Monday, showed. It was also observed that the annual capacity payment loss to power generation companies had increased to N1.8tn, as data from the document further showed a decrease in the average utilised power in 2022. Figures obtained from power generation companies indicated that while the average quantum of electricity utilised in 2021 was 4,118.98MW, it dropped to 3,940.54MW in 2022. The document on Power Generation Trend (2013 – 2022), showed that Nigeria’s average available generation capacity fluctuated between 4,000MW and 7,700MW since the sector was privatised in 2013. Also, the average utilised generation hovered between 3,000MW and 4,000MW during the nine-year review period, while unutilised generation revolved around 1,000MW and 3,700MW. Figures from the document showed that Nigeria’s average available power generation capacity in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 were 4,214.32MW; 6,154.05MW; 6,616.28MW; and 7,039.96MW respectively. In 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the average available generation capacity figures were 6,871.26MW; 7,506.23MW; 7,381.67MW; and 7,792.51MW respectively. Since 2018, the figures kept dropping, as those of 2021 and 2022 were 6,336.52MW and 5,346.82MW respectively. For average utilised generation, the Gencos’ report stated that in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, the quantum of electricity utilised was 3,183.51MW; 3,419.1MW; 3,606.05MW; and 3,212.02MW respectively. The average utilised power in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 were put at 3,599.33MW; 3,807.22MW; 3,782MW; and 4,050.07MW respectively. For 2021 and 2022, the average quantum of utilised electricity were 4,118.98MW and 3,940.54MW respectively, according to the figures from the power generation companies. The Gencos also stated in the document that the total capacity payment loss to power producers from 2015 to 2022 had increased to N1.8tn. The report showed that in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, the annual capacity payment loss was N214.93bn, N273.32bn, N236.47bn and N264.08bn respectively. For 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, the figures for annual capacity payment loss were put at N256.97bn, N266.1bn, N159.86bn and N132.19bn respectively. Commenting on the development, the Executive Secretary, Association, Power Generation Companies, Joy Ogaji, said the sector was only recording about 100MW growth in power generation yearly. She wondered if the vision of generating about 30,000MW in Nigeria by 2030 was feasible, stressing that with the trend in power generation over the years, one could project the future of electricity production in Nigeria. Ogaji said, “100MW per annum growth. We can project easily in 20 years where we can be, aside the political megawatts projection. Do we really have a market? If yes what are the dynamics underpinning it? “Is vision 2030 viable? At 100MW per annum by 2030 we only need to add 700MW and we can foretell our target. Is 30,000MW projection realistic?” The Deputy President, Nigeria Labour Congress, Joe Ajaero, recently described Nigeria’s power sector as a failure, stressing that both the Federal Government and operators had failed to meet the expectations of electricity consumers nationwide. The Federal Government, however, opposed the position of labour, as it argued that the power sector was now healthy despite the challenges confronting the industry. But Ajaero, who doubles as the General Secretary, National Union of Electricity Employees, told our correspondent that the quantum of electricity produced in the sector had failed to increase since the sector was privatised in November 2013. He said the stagnancy in power generation had continued despite the persistent rise in the demand for electricity by consumers. Asked to speak on the sector’s performance in 2022, Ajaero said, “If you’re looking at the power sector, since you asked me to use a word to qualify it, the power sector is a failing sector. It is a failing sector, and this means that it is going down, down, down. “This is because the megawatts produced in that sector have remained constant, while the demand for it is increasing by the day. If Nigeria had any conscious master plan, it would have ensured that power production grows to meet up with demand.”
