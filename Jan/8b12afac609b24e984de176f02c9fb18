The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has announced that provision of email addresses is now compulsory for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination registration beginning from Tuesday, January 31, 2023. The admissions board made this known in a statement released on Monday by its Head, Public Affairs and Protocol, Dr. Fabian Benjamin, adding that no candidate will be registered henceforth, without an email address provided. Although registration is ongoing, JAMB explained that going forward, the new development would ensure that the process of capturing all relevant data pertaining to the candidates was more flexible and easy, adding however that the board would not retrieve lost email passwords or change email addresses for candidates once registered. It also added that the latest advisory would facilitate the transmission of urgent and vital communication to candidates cheaply and more efficiently. The statement partly read, “Furthermore, e-mail provides more flexibility in communication and is a more professional way of reaching out to candidates. “Candidates are, therefore, advised to get their genuine e-mail addresses before proceeding with UTME registration. “In addition, candidates are to ensure that their passwords are kept securely as the board does not retrieve lost e-mail passwords or change e-mail addresses once registered.” The PUNCH reports that the 2023 UTME registration began Saturday, January 14, 2023, and will end Tuesday, February 14, 2023.
