The Senate has said the Independent National Electoral Commission has no excuse to give as far as required credibility of the coming general elections is concerned. This, he said, was because it had met all the requirements of the electoral umpire. It added that since funds and materials needed for the smooth conduct of the elections had been provided by the executive in collaboration with the legislature, there should be no room for any excuse from the electoral body. The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, made his remarks at the plenary on Tuesday. Lawan charged the electoral umpire to be on top of its game to ensure that the February polls met the expectations of Nigerians. He said, “INEC has got everything it has asked for, from the legislature, to aid the conduct of a credible election and as such excuses will not be condoned. “The security agencies have also assured everyone that the environment will be safe and secure for citizens to go out and cast their votes without any hindrance.” He, however, added that the National Assembly was ever ready to support INEC and other agencies of government that would work to ensure free, fair and credible elections in February. He urged Nigerians to leverage the window of collection of the Permanent Voter Cards as stated by INEC, to collect them to exercise their franchise. “2023 will redefine the future of the country as Nigerians prepare to elect officers to the various positions both in the national and state levels,” he added.
