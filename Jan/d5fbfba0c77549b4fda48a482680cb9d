Former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar (retd.), on Wednesday lamented the spread of insurgency from North East to other parts of the country. Abdulsalami spoke in his address at the public presentation of a book titled “Preventing Crimes, Insurgencies and Desperate Migrations in Nations of the World,” a compendium of three books, written by Iliyasu Maijega, at the Shehu Musa Yar’Adua Centre, in Abuja. He noted that the book throws light into the causes of the insurgency, and would go a long way in helping the government and security agencies tackle the menace. The former Head of State said, “As the author has put his thoughts on paper, may I pray that peace comes down to our country and our region. “I want to commend the author for tackling and putting his thoughts on our current situation. “For the last 10 years or so, we have been battling with the insurgency in the northeastern states, which has gradually spread all over the country.” “I believe his book, has thrown light into the causes of this insurgency. I believe these books will go a long way in helping our security agencies and the government, in tackling these problems.”
