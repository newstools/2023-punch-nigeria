The Presidency, on Monday, described as “vengeful” and “selfish” the attitude of former President Olusegun Obasanjo to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). Citing Buhari’s recent role as Africa’s “anti-corruption champion” and praises from United States President Joe Biden in early December, the Presidency claimed that the stark difference between the two leaders has made Obasanjo “jealous” and “vengeful”. “Clearly, Obasanjo has become even more jealous by adopting a vengeful attitude,” a statement signed by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, read Monday evening. Shehu’s statement comes barely 24 hours after Obasanjo berated the Buhari-led government describing its tenure as “hell on earth” for Nigerians. In his remarks on Sunday, the former President also said under Buhari, “Nigeria of today had been dragged down well below Nigeria of the beginning of my Presidency in June 1999.” But Shehu noted that “Obasanjo’s vengeful attitude towards President Buhari is the height of selfishness and little short of moral squalor.” The Presidential spokesman also claimed that “‘hell’ for Obasanjo is when any President that comes after him refuses to be his own puppet, to do as he wishes on all matters and at all times.”
