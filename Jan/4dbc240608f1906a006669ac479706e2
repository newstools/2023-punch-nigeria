The National Chairman, South West Agenda for Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Senator Dayo Adeyeye, said on Tuesday that the decision of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, could not in any way affect the victory of All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, in the February 25 election. Adeyeye, who dismissed Obasanjo’s endorsement on Sunday of Labour Party’s candidate, Peter Obi, said, “Tinubu’s record and contributions to nation-building in the last three decades will work in his favour above other contenders.” The SWAGA leader, who spoke in Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, during a party organised for members of the campaign group in Ekiti, Ondo, Kogi and other states expressed confidence that SWAGA would deliver 14 million votes for the APC candidate in the South West. The APC chieftain, who is the Director of Support Groups in the party’s Presidential Campaign Council, said, “Obasanjo’s endorsement of LP candidate will have absolutely no negative impact on the election of Asiwaju Tinubu; we are in the South West here and we know the politics of the region. “The former president, Chief Obasanjo, has the right to endorse any candidate, and it is also our constitutional right to support and canvass for whoever we like. I can tell you that the people of South West, even the people of Egba land where Obasanjo comes from, will vote massively for Tinubu and he will win. “As SWAGA, we have met over 300 traditional rulers in Yoruba land, and the candidate himself has done that too and all of them have endorsed him. Afenifere has endorsed him including all Yoruba leaders, what Obasanjo has done will not have any impact on the chances of Bola Tinubu in the forthcoming election,” he said. Adeyeye, countering health issues added, “The health of a man is in the hands of God. Let me tell you many who said President Muhammadu Buhari will die in 2015 have died.”
