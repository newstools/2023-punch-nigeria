The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, has decried the explosion that took place during an All Progressives Congress campaign rally in Rivers State, saying there should be no place for violence and anti-democratic manifestations in this election. Atiku stated this via his verified Facebook page on Thursday. The PUNCH reports that no fewer than three persons were injured when a twin explosion rocked the rally of the APC at the Rumuwoji Playground in Port Harcourt, the state capital. Two of those injured are women, all of whom were rushed to the hospital for medical attention. The Publicity Secretary of the APC in the state, Darlington Nwauju, confirmed the incident, describing it as ‘unfortunate.’ Reacting, the PDP standard bearer said, “There should be no place for violence and anti-democratic manifestations in this election. “We’ve already committed to that in the peace pact we all signed.” Atiku said elections should not be be a do-or-die affair but an opportunity to reinforce people’s belief in democracy. “We had complained about the violence that had been visited on our party in some states because we did not want it to become a pattern if those engaged in anti-democratic activities were not brought to book. “Our worst fears have now manifested with the explosion at the APC rally in Port Harcourt. It stands condemned. “Elections and the choices we make should be about the BALLOT and not the BULLET. “On behalf of my team, I stand in solidarity with the APC and the families of the injured. I wish the injured a quick recovery,” he added. Atiku called on security agencies to ensure that those behind the dastardly act, including their promoters, were brought to justice “to serve as a deterrent to copycats who may be emboldened to thread this same anti-democratic path.”
