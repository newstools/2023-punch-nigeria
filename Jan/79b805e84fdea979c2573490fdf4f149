Gunmen have shot dead a medical doctor identified as Dr Uyi Iluobe as they attacked his hospital, Olive Clinic, in Oghara-eki community in Delta State. PUNCH Metro gathered that Dr Iluobe was gruesomely murdered inside his clinic on the evening of December 29, 2022, as he was busy attending to a female patient in the consulting room. Sources said the patient, who is currently at large, had complained of severe body pain and was being given urgent attention, even without doing the necessary registration and documentation, when suddenly the assailants besieged the clinic and shot the doctor dead. It was gathered that immediately after the gunshot, the female supposed patient hurriedly joined the assassins as they all eloped in a car parked outside the hospital while the fear gripped hospital staff were still lying face down. Sources close to the family of the slain doctor revealed that prior to the gory incident, Dr Uyi Iluobe had received numerous threats in the course of his services either by patients who did not want to pay for services rendered or those who felt he should offer free care to them by force. It was further gathered that a few days before he was assassinated, a gunshot victim was brought to the clinic and Dr Iluobe advised that a police report be procured in accordance with the enabling laws before treatment could be commenced but those who brought that victim rather insisted that he be treated even without police notification. As the doctor stood his ground and refused to treat that gunshot victim, those who brought him reportedly became furious and took the gunshot victim away angrily. Meanwhile, the lifeless body of the deceased medical doctor has been deposited in the mortuary while the security agencies are making efforts to fish out his killers. The Police Public Relations Officer for Delta State Command, DSP Bright Edafe, could not be reached for comments on the incident as of the time of filing this report.
