The Nigeria LNG Limited has said its plant on Bonny Island is still active despite a force majeure declared in October 2022 and feed gas supply challenges. The General Manager, External Relations and Sustainable Development, NLNG, Mr Andy Odeh, confirmed this in a statement on Monday in Lagos. Odeh said the plant continued to produce LNG and Liquefied Petroleum Gas commensurate with the feed gas it received from its upstream suppliers. “In addition to ensuring steady operation, NLNG remains committed to its culture of transparency and maintains consistent communication with key stakeholders on developments in the upstream sector. “The company is closely monitoring the resolution of supply challenges by all relevant parties,” he added. However, the News Agency of Nigeria reports that average retail price paid by consumers to purchase Liquefied Petroleum Gas also known as cooking gas, has continued to skyrocket.
