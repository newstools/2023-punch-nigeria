The Katsina State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has disagreed with the ruling All Progressive Congress in the state that 1,900 PDP members in Danmusa Local Government allegedly defected to the APC on Sunday. The APC campaign council spokesperson, Ahmed Abdulkadir, had claimed that a popular politician in the state, Sani Abụ, was among the defectors. He said, “The Katsina State APC gubernatorial candidate, Dr. Dikko Umar Radda stormed Ɗanmusa Local Government Area and took over the supporters of the erstwhile Secretary to Katsina State Government, Mustapha Inuwa. “More than 1900 supporters of the former SGS crossed-carpets from mainly PDP and other parties into the APC. They were received by the APC Katsina State Gubernatorial Candidate himself, Dr. Dikko Radda.” Reacting to the claim, the PDP’s campaign council spokesperson, Kabir Yar’adu’a, asked the APC to present the defectors.

Premium Times reported that Yar’adu’a said the APC was nothing but an “architect of deceits and fake news.” He noted that the number of registered voters according to the Independent National Electoral Commission in 10 local government areas, including Danmusa, had 142,261 voters. The council spokesperson said, “How, therefore, APC gets its 1,900 decampees out of that figure? This is apart from those voters who were displaced by banditry, and those who migrated and relocated to other places. “It, therefore, treats our imagination for the Director of APC campaign council to make such callous, unsubstantiated and biased judgment by reportedly conscripting such figure and arriving at wrong conclusion.””
