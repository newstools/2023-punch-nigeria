The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, has called on all Nigerians to unite their efforts to build a new country. Obi in his New Year message made available to The PUNCH on Sunday, told Nigerians that 2023 is a critical year and time in the nation urging them to take back Nigeria in order to resolve all the challenges facing the country as they elect leaders in February 2023. Adding that the forthcoming elections would determine the direction of the country in the next four years, Obi stressed the importance of uniting against failed leadership and choosing right, adding that he would fulfill all campaign promises if given the opportunity to govern the country. The LP candidate said, “2023 is an existential year in the history of our nation. It is a year we all must unite against the continued abuse of our nation’s democracy and economy. The power is in our hands to take back our nation, in the coming year, and make it work.” Calling on Nigerians to support him in saving the nation, Obi restated his commitment to securing the country, unifying the nation and moving it from consumption to production. He told Nigerians to hold him accountable to his promises for a better nation, when given access to power. “I have made a pact with Nigerians and I will not leave any of my promises unfulfilled. Nigerians can hold me accountable by my words of promise,” Obi added. He wished Nigerians a very productive 2023 and urged them to remain law abiding, while contributing to the growth and development of the nation.
