The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, has returned to Nigeria from the United Kingdom. Former presidential aide, Reno Omokri, shared a video of Atiku’s arrival on his Twitter page on Thursday night. In the video, Atiku was seen in company with Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel; Sokoto Governor, Aminu Tambuwal; former Kogi senator, Dino Melaye; former National PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus; erstwhile aviation minister, Osita Chidoka; and former Senate President, Bukola Saraki. The video was captioned, “The Next President of Nigeria (God willing) is back in Nigeria after a most successful trip to the UK.” Atiku arrived in London on Monday for a meeting with the British government. The former vice president had stated that his trip was for the purpose of having “critical meetings that will build the necessary bridges in our quest to recover Nigeria.” During the trip, Atiku met with the UK’s Minister for Development and Africa in the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, Andrew Mitchell, among other key senior UK government officials, where the PDP’s presidential candidate solicited their support in helping Nigeria recover every facet of its life. On Wednesday, he also held a closed-door meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Most Revd Justin Welby, in the United Kingdom.
