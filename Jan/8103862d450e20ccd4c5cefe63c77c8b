No fewer than 16 bandits were killed when air strikes by the air component of Operation Hadarin Daji targeted their enclave along Kaura Namoda Road in Zurmi Local Government Area of Zamfara State. Also, during the operation, a wanted terrorist kingpin, Gwoska Dankarami, was said to have escaped death narrowly. According to a report by the military seen by our correspondent on Sunday, Dankarami escaped with injuries during the operation conducted on New Year’s Eve. The military report quoted a source privy to the modus operandi of the terrorist kingpin as confirming overhearing the terrorist lamenting the determination of the military to eliminate him and his family. The report read, “He was also heard to have complained bitterly about the New Year’s Eve air strikes, which lasted for several hours, killing over 16 of his cohorts and destroying his newly-built house as well as his enclave. “According to the source, Dankarami also expressed deep concern about the dire situation he has found himself in since it became clear that the military was hell-bent on eliminating him at any cost.” When contacted, NAF spokesperson, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, confirmed the airstrikes while noting that Dankarami and his likes remain persons of interest to the NAF and all security agencies as a result of the evil they have perpetrated. “The directive of the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, that there is no hiding place for all terrorists and their supporters, wherever they may be, remains active even as we cross into the New Year,” he added.
