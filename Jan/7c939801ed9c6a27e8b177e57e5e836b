The Spiritual Director, Adoration Ministry Enugu Nigeria Catholic Chaplaincy, Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka, has returned from monastery after eight months suspension. The PUNCH had reported that the Church was closed down earlier in the year and on June 3, 2022 the Catholic Diocese of Enugu banned Mbaka from commenting on political issues after activities in the ministry were suspended. Upon reopening, the Church turned the ministry into Chaplaincy to monitor the excesses in the ministry. In October 2022, the Catholic Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Most Rev. Callistus Onaga, had transferred Mbaka from chaplaincy to the monastery. Consequently, Rev. Fr. Anthony Amadi was named to replace him (Mbaka) as the new chaplain of the Adoration Ministry Chaplaincy. Details soonâ€¦
