The Director of Strategic Engagement for the Abia State Peoples Democratic Party Campaign Council, Chief John Kalu, has said Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, did not attend the party’s mega rally in Enugu State because he was still mourning the death of the Abia governorship candidate, Prof Uche Ikonne. The mega rally was held in Enugu State on Friday to officially set the ball rolling for the state governor and candidate for the Enugu-North Senatorial District, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi. The rally was attended by G-5 governors: Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, Samuel Ortom of Benue State; and Seyi Makinde of Oyo State. Ikpeazu, who is also a member of the political group, was conspicuously absent, which fuelled the speculation that he might have left the group. The G-5, a group of five PDP governors led by Wike, severed ties with the national leadership of the party for not honouring what it called ‘the agreement to return power to the South’. Putting the rumours to rest, Kalu, in a Saturday statement made available to Sunday PUNCH on Saturday, said Ikpeazu was still mourning Ikonne and would not be attending any political event till Monday. The statement read in part, “As a mark of honour to our dear departed brother, Ikpeazu directed that all flags in Abia State PDP offices be lowered and flown at half-mast while all campaign activities for the party at all levels be suspended until Monday, January 30, 2023. “Governor Ikpeazu, in particular, every well-meaning member of our political family (PDP) and, indeed, Abians, in general, are not in any mood for any political gathering at this point.
