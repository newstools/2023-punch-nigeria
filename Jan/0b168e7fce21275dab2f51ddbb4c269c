Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom said on Monday that he cancelled his medical vacation to intensify campaign for the Peoples Democratic Party governorship candidate in the state. Ortom also added that the party will work tirelessly to dismantle “evil forces” against the state. The governor made the disclosure while addressing the PDP caucus meeting in Makurdi, the Benue State capital. This is as he said that he would work around the clock to educate the public about the evil determined on assuming the state plum seat. According to him, “I was supposed to embark on my medical vacation, but I have cancelled it and decided to stay back so that we can all fully embark on our campaigns for the party’s governorship candidate, Titus Uba and others. “We will be going to all the LGAs in the state, and all our candidates will be fully involved. After that, we will break into groups and embark on house-to-house. The senatorial candidates will lead in their districts, as will the House of Representatives and State Assembly candidates. “I will not leave our gubernatorial candidate alone; I will stand with him. The election is about the soul of Benue State, and no evil man will come in whatever guise in a bid to take over Benue State; we shall crush them. “I have the mandate to hand over my mantle to someone I trust who can continue from where I left off. So I am committed both in my prayers and physically to stand against any evil force. I will stand with our governorship candidate.” It will be recalled that with the emergence of the Catholic priest, Rev. Fr. Hyacinth Alia, as the APC governorship candidate in the state, the ruling PDP has lost sleep.
