A singer, Temitope Bankole, narrates the brutal attack on her 10 years ago left her traumatised. Bankole said she moved back to Lagos in 2006 with her siblings, in order to pursue her career and education. She got a house in the Iyana-paja area of Lagos which was owned by one Ebenezer Obadina. She said that she observed that the landlord’s son, Tobi, was in the habit of physically assaulting women in the house.  A traumatised Bankole narrated how Tobi manhandled her in the kitchen one day in 2012 and said that she was the only woman he had yet to beat in the compound. Another time, he drove at top speed towards her. She only survived because she was able to jump to the other side of the road.  On the day Tobi succeeded in physically assaulting her, Bankole said he used broken bottle and glass cup to stab her all over her body, while threatening neighbours who tried to intervene with the same treatment. Bankole claimed that after she crawled to his father, who was at home during the stabbing, asking for help, he refused to offer any, merely wanting to keep her there, while she bled. She was eventually taken to the hospital.  However, the journey to getting justice has been rough and involved being asked for sex by a lawyer, who offered to help.  Bankole said she’s crying out now for justice because Tobi has not stopped threatening her and her family members
