Music streaming platform, Spotify, suffered a brief outage in the United States Friday night that left several users without access to the live music streaming platform. The platform is now back online. Several Spotify users reported the sudden stoppage of streaming, as some said they logged out and couldn’t log in again. “Everything’s looking much better now!” an account that provides updates about the audio platform’s status, Spotify Status, said on Twitter, early Saturday. It had earlier tweeted, “Something’s not quite right, and we’re looking into it. Thanks for your reports!” Over 40 thousand users in the US could have been affected as a platform that tracks outages through some sources including user reports, Downdetector, showed more than 45,000 users were affected from the US at the peak of the disruption. Downdetector revealed this in a chart on its site at about 3am, Saturday.
