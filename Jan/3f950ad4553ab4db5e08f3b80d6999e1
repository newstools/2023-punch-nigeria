A renowned disability inclusion activist and founder of the Children’s Developmental Centre, Dr Olayinka Labake Akindayomi, has died at age 66. Akindayomi built up services provision and support for families with children and adults of autism, all developmental and intellectual disabilities. A notable voice in the disability sector in Nigeria for about 28 years, she also initiated the CDC to champion activities leading to the development, supervision, awareness and outreach programmes on disability issues. Reacting to her shocking death, the family, management and staff of the CDC expressed their grief in a statement made available on Thursday evening. It read, “The family of Charles Akindayomi, Management and Staff of the Children’s Developmental Centre (CDC) regret to announce the passing of their Founder, CEO and Service Director, Dr Olayinka Labake Akindayomi (nee Afolabi) on January 6, 2023, aged 66. “She was a trailblazer and an amazon in the disability community who did remarkable work, particularly in the intellectual and developmental disability space for over 30 years. “Indeed, this special community has lost a warrior.  She will be sorely missed.
