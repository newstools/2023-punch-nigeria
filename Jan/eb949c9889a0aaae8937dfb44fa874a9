Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, has met separately with the leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria and Muslim clerics in the Oriire Local Government Area of the state over his second term bid. Makinde, in a statement made available by his Chief Press Secretary, Taiwo Adisa, on Wednesday, declared that his administration was set to turn the five local governments in Ogbomoso Zone into Agro-Industrial Processing Zones. The governor, while addressing CAN leaders at the First Baptist Church in Ikoyi-Ile on Tuesday, maintained that the state is progressing in terms of economic emancipation. He added that the present administration has laid the necessary foundation for the economic prosperity of the state by connecting all the zones in the state. The governor said, “I have noted a few of the things you said, especially the issue of grading rural roads. We have put something in place to help us fix the rural roads. But what it means is that the effort is not enough, and we have to put in more. So, I promise you that we will do the needful soon. “For most of the things we are doing, we are laying foundations gradually, and one of the major foundations is connecting our zones. “If our people can farm, operate in a safe and secure environment, and access infrastructure to transport their produce, it means we are getting somewhere in terms of economic emancipation. So, we will continue to push the frontier, and under Omituntun 2.0, we will do better.” Earlier in his remarks, Sunday Olojede, General Secretary CAN, Ogbomoso zone, commended Makinde on the numerous commendable projects his administration has undertaken in the zones. Similarly, Makinde also met with the leadership of the Ikoyi-Ile Muslim Community at the Ikoyi-Ile Central Mosque, where he charged the Muslim Ummah to work hand in hand and cooperate with his government and to also re-elect him so that he can continue to move the state from poverty to prosperity.
