The leader of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria, Sheik Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, on Monday, blamed the United States for the terrorism in the Middle East. In a statement he personally signed, El-Zakzaky said he arrived at the conclusion following the killing of an Iranian general, Qaseem Soleimani, which the US took responsibility for. He stated that the killing of Soleimani, which happened on January 3, 2020, only immortalised the general and the struggle which he gave his life for. He said, “It is three years since we lost this great Mujahid who has been an icon of the struggle against terrorism and whose murder has exposed who the real terrorists are. “The US boasted of taking responsibility for his murder.  This clearly shows that they were all behind the terrorist activities in the Middle East, particularly in Iraq and Syria, where they have packages of terrorist groups under different names of DAESH, ISIS, and the like. “No doubt, they have made a grievous mistake by the murder of General Qaseem Soleimani. First, they have exposed themselves; and secondly, they have made his name and himself immortal.  They have immortalised him by this murder and they also immortalised the struggle in which he has given his life. “We pray to Allah to have mercy on the soul of General Qaseem Soleimani and his colleague Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and those martyrs in the course of freedom in the Middle East and the entire world. “We also hope and pray that their legacy will remain indelible until the final victory over the world arrogance and the establishment of justice all over.”
