Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has said he could have got a third term in office if he wanted, saying he is “audacious enough” to get it. This is as he says he won’t join the campaign train of the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, saying he has done his best by writing his endorsement. The former president said these while speaking on Thursday at a virtual engagement organised by Africa Leadership Group. The PUNCH reports that Obasanjo had in his New Year message to Nigerians, titled “My appeal to all Nigerians particularly young Nigerians,” thrown his weight behind Obi. The ex-president said he had no regret leading Nigeria. Obasanjo said, “I am not in campaign train. I’ve used benefit of my experience and I’ve put plainly. “I do not belong to any political party. I will not join any campaign train. I’ve said what is best for the country.” Speaking on what to look out for in the next president, Obasanjo said, “Nigeria is where we are because of leadership. “We must decisively look for men and women who have the character, attributes, skill and attitude that we need for leadership, that will deliver in this country.” The former president however refuted claims that he wanted a third term as President of the country. Obasanjo said he would have had it if he had wanted. Obasanjo said, “I never asked for a third term. If I wanted a third term, I would have got it. I am audacious enough to know how to get it.” Speaking on the Nigerian constitution, Obasanjo called for an amendment, noting that no constitution was perfect. He said, “Some people blame the constitution for everything in Nigeria. Of course, our constitution is not perfect, and there is no constitution that is sacrosanct and it can be amended.” He said part of what should be included in the amended constitution is the devolution of power.
