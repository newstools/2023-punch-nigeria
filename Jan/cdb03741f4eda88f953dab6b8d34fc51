The Federal Government, through the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation, is set to pay the withheld salaries and allowances of lecturers under the aegis of the Congress of Nigerian Universities Academics, The PUNCH has learnt. This was contained in a memo addressed to the President, CONUA, Dr Niyi Sunmonu by the Director, Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System, Office of the Accountant General of the Federation, Charles Wali. The PUNCH had reported how the government had withheld the salaries of Nigerian lecturers during the eight-month strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities. During the strike, the government also registered CONUA as a trade union. The President of CONUA, Dr Niyi Sunmonu, in an earlier interview with The PUNCH, noted that members of his union did not embark on strike and hence should not have their salaries withheld. The union had written to the Federal Government. In a memo dated January 13, 2022, the government noted that the withheld salaries will be released. The letter partly reads, “You may wish to forward the following details to facilitate seamless deduction and remittance of check-off dues; evidence of registration; official account details of the union; membership list of the union, signed by each member; percentage of deduction (check-off dues)/amount to be deducted from each member; mode of remittance between the headquarters and local chapters. “Please note that details of members which must always be hard and soft copies should also include individual IPPIS numbers for ease of identification.”
