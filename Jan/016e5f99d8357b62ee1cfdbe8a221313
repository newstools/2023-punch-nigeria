The Supreme Court of Nigeria has affirmed Senator Adamu Aliero as the Peoples Democratic Party’s candidate for Kebbi Central Senatorial District in the forthcoming general election. In a lead judgment by Justice Centus Nweze which was read by Justice Amina Augie on Monday, the apex court held that Aliero’s appeal was allowed and declared that “the judgment of the lower court, which declared Saidu Haruna as the winner of the Kebbi Central Senatorial District primary is hereby set aside.” However, while four justices on the panel unanimously agreed with the lead judgment, Justice Emmanuel Agim disagreed. The judgment followed an appeal by Aliero challenging the decision of the Court of Appeal to nullify his candidacy.
