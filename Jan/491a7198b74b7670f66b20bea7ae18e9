The President of the Association of Psychiatrists of Nigeria, Prof Taiwo Obindo, who confirmed the signing, described it as a great relief to the mental health care and practice in the country. Vanguard quoted him as saying, “A final culmination to over two decades of several efforts by the Association of Psychiatrists of Nigeria now has an Act/Law on Mental Health governance and we are now part of the global space with best global practice.” A former president of the APN, Prof Taiwo Shielk also appreciated God for the signage of the Mental Health Bill has been signed into law by the President. Thanking key players in the process, Shielk said, “Our profound gratitude to Senator Dr. Ibrahim Oloriegbe, Senator Ahmad Abubakar, Dr. Ibrahim Gambari, CBM International, Johnson & Johnson, and all our partners.
