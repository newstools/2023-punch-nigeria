The Nigeria Police Force disclosed on Wednesday that it is prosecuting Prof. Zainab Duke-Abiola for the alleged assault of a female police officer, Inspector Teju Moses. It noted that the alleged assault took place on Tuesday, September 20, 2022, at her residence in Garki, Abuja, alongside her domestic staff, one Rebecca Enechido, and a male suspect currently at large. This was disclosed in a statement by the Force Public Relations Officer, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, on Wednesday. Adejobi said, “The FCT Police Command, under whose jurisdiction the matter transpired, has charged the suspects to court upon diligent investigation, and the case with charge no. CR/544/22 is ongoing, and the next hearing will come up on February 1, 2023, at High Court 16, Zuba, FCT, Abuja. “The suspects have been charged with the offences of criminal conspiracy, attempt to commit culpable homicide, voluntarily causing hurt without provocation, and assault to deter public servant from discharge of his duty amongst others. The recent media row by the suspect is therefore unnecessary, as the matter has not been concluded in court. “It is similarly pertinent to note that the spurious allegations recently made in the news hold no water as the Nigeria Police reposes confidence in the judiciary, believing that the courts will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that justice is done in the extant case.”
