The governor of Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun, says his administration has reconstructed over 400 kilometres of highways in three years and seven months. Abiodun said this on Monday during the inauguration of the 18-kilometre Ejirin -Idowa-Ibefun-Itokin road in the Odogbolu Local Government Area of the state. Abiodun said that since the commencement of his campaign, his administration had been able to inaugurate road construction in all the local governments visited so far. Abiodun added, “we inaugurated the Itori township road in Ewekoro Local Government Area last week. We are in Ijebu East where we inaugurated the Esure road. “The road we are commissioning today is a connecting road between Ogun and Lagos states. It is a Federal Government road but in a deplorable condition. We must not allow our people to suffer. “We have paid attention to roads that connect neighbouring states, especially Lagos. We are determined to build the future of Ogun State together. “We have reconstructed over 400 kilometres of highways in three years and seven months. “After spending eight years, we may not have constructed all roads but we would have made a positive difference.” The Dagburewe of Idowa, Oba Yinusa Adekoya, lauded the governor for fulfilling his promise. Adekoya said that the road was in a dilapidated condition before the governor came into office.
