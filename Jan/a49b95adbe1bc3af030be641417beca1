Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, has commended the Independent National Electoral Commission for the introduction of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System. Akeredolu noted that with the introduction of the new technology, it would be impossible for elections to be rigged again in Nigeria. The governor, who stated that in his office, in Akure, when he received the outgoing Resident Electoral Commissioner in the state, Dr Rufus Akeju, said, “I am happy that it’s getting more and more difficult for anybody to influence INEC to rig the election. I have been involved in so many elections and I keep telling people an election is difficult to rig. “It has become more difficult now, because whether we like it or not, INEC has improved on its work over time, and I want to congratulate you (Akeju) and the chairman for the good work you are doing.” Akeredolu, who also lauded the retiring REC for there was no election that was inconclusive during his time in the state,  urged INEC to find a way to add more value to the PVC aside from its usage for voting, to make it more attractive for the people to collect. Earlier, the retiring Resident Electoral Commissioner, Rufus Akeju thanked the Ondo State Government and residents of the state for their support and cooperation during his tenure.
