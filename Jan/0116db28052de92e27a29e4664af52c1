The Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, has taken a swipe at the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, saying Nigeria’s presidency is not “turn by turn”. Speaking on Monday when he arrived in Delta State for his campaign, the former Anambra State governor explained that if the presidency was to be turn by turn, it would be his “turn” by succeeding the President, Major General Buhari (retd), this year. “Somebody said it is his turn to be president, I want to tell you that the president is not turn by turn. If it is turn by turn, it is supposed to be my turn but we are not using turn by turn. It is the turn of Nigerians to be president especially those full of energy. “No tribe buys bread or rice cheaper, no religion buys bread cheaper. Vote for commitment and capacity. “We are not going to give excuses. I am not going to remind you of where you’re coming from or blame people where they failed. Am assuring you that a new Nigeria is possible. “Hold me responsible if we failed you in the area of security, economy. We will make the country work again. There will be no more strikes in the education sector again in this country,” Obi said. The former governor also lamented that the Niger Delta region was backward judging by the resources accrued to it. He promised to turn the region around if elected as the president. He said, “We have gone to Warri, Isoko, Agbor, and Asaba only today, that shows you our seriousness and commitment, and all the places, people came out en-mass. “Niger Delta supposed to be a haven, things are not working in the region. From here to Warri is supposed to be dualized. East-Eest road has been constructed for the past 24 years, but nothing is working in this region.”
