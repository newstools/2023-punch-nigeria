American rapper, Dr Dre, has objected to the use of his music in a social media video by lawmaker, Marjorie Taylor Greene, to celebrate her role in the emergence of Kevin McCarthy as the US Congress Speaker. Greene had used the song, ‘Still Dre’ in the video on Monday. The video has now been removed from Twitter “in response to a report from the copyright owner.” Speaking to TMZ, the rap mogul said, “I don’t license my music to politicians, especially someone as divisive and hateful as this one.” In the nearly two-minute video, the staunch Donald Trump supporter from Georgia walks out of her office in slow motion to the familiar first notes of Dre’s 1999 hit with Snoop Dogg.
