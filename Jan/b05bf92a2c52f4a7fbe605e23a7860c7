A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has sacked the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the Aboh Mbaise/Ngor Okpala federal constituency of Imo State, Albert Agulanna. The court, on Friday, in its ruling in a suit initiated by Uzoma Ugochukwu from Aboh Mbaise, ordered that a fresh primary be held in the constituency within the next 14 days. Aboh Mbaise/Ngor Okpala federal constituency is the constituency of the immediate past governor of the state, Emeka Ihedioha. This came less than one week after the PDP candidate for Imo West senatorial district, Jones Onyereri, was sacked by the Supreme Court, according to a report by The Nation. Ihedioha had been accused of masterminding the sacking of Onyereri, while the National Secretary of the party, Samuel Anyanwu, was said to be behind the sacking of Agulanna. According to reports, Ihedioha and Anyanwu are interested in the PDP  governorship ticket for the November 11 in Imo State. While some of the members of the party in the state expressed are worried over the internal crisis, the spokesperson, Collins Opuruozor, said,  “Enemies of the party who were afraid of the PDP’s public acceptance were using the courts to knock off the PDP from the ballot.”
