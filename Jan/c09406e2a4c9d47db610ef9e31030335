The Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Matthew Kukah, has said the biggest challenge for the nation now is how to have elections that are free, fair and credible. He, therefore, called on Nigerians to work towards an election in which votes would count. Kukah said these in an interview with The PUNCH. He said Nigerians needed to look at themselves in the mirror and ask themselves if they are better off now than before. He wondered how many phases of national life Nigerians can proudly want to remember with joy and celebration. The bishop said, “The people of Morocco, for instance, will look at how they beat Brazil in the World Cup. It is left for Nigerians to ask how they feel about the years that have gone by, but the future is now in our hands. “Hopefully, and prayerfully, we will have another round of elections, and we hope that we will have elections that are free from violence and free from manipulation. From what we’ve heard from INEC, the process is becoming clearer. “I think the biggest challenge for us now is that we have elections that are free, fair, and credible, and we can live with the results that they produce. “Let us run first before we talk about a re-rerun. “We just hope that the elections will be free, fair, and credible, so a winner will emerge. “I don’t think we should begin to talk about the possibility of a rerun or whatever because we are just heating the system. I think we should just assume that we are.” Kukah also dismissed political permutations that the 2023 elections would end in a rerun, saying, “Let us run first before we talk about a rerun.”
