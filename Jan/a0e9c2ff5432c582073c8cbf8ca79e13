The Bauchi State coordinator for the New Nigeria Peoples Party presidential campaign team, Dr Babayo Liman, has dumped the party for the Peoples Democratic Party. Liman, who is also the North-East Zonal Secretary of the party announced his resignation at a news conference on Monday in Bauchi. “I want to formally inform the general public, especially members of the NNPP in Bauchi State, North-East and Nigeria at large, that I have resigned as a member of the NNPP. “I have also resigned as the zonal secretary of the North-East as well as member and coordinator of the Presidential Campaign Council of the NNPP presidential candidate, Dr Rabiu Kwnkwaso. “Let the general public know that I have withdrawn my membership from the NNPP, I am no more with the NNPP from today,” he said. He said that he ditched the NNPP for the PDP alongside large numbers of his supporters, adding that the party lacked structure to win elections in the country. He said that his decision to switch camp also stemmed from internal crisis, flagrant disregard of the rule of law and lack of unity among members due to poor leadership of the party. According to him, the NNPP’s leadership poorly managed its affairs resulting to emergence of various factions. He, therefore, convassed votes for the PDP and its candidates at all levels in the forthcoming election. Also speaking, Ward Chairman of the PDP, Makama Sarkin-Baki in Bauchi Local Government Area of the state, Yusuf Marafa, welcomed the defectors. He described PDP as the most organised party that conducts its political affairs like a family. He pledged that the party would accommodate and ensure equal treatment of its members. NAN
