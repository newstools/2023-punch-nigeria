Kwankwaso made the promised at the Northwest presidential campaign and handing of flag to the party’s governorship candidates at the main bowl of the Ahmadu Bello Stadium, Kaduna, on Saturday. He also reiterated his earlier commitment to providing enabling environment in the education sector through the payment of WAEC, NECO and JAMB fees for all Nigerian students. The presidential hopeful said he would address drug abuse among Nigerian youth which he noted had become a major challenge, saying that he would address it holistically and rehabilitate victims of such abuse across the country. This was just as his running mate, Bishop Isaac Idahosa, insisted at that Nigeria needed a “deliverer” like Kwankwaso as next president of the country. Idahosa noted that the party would unite Nigerians and restore peace across the land. Idahosa said, “Nigeria at this critical times needs not just a president but a deliverer and Kwankwaso is the only one that can save the country from her myriad of challenges.”
