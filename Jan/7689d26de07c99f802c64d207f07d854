The Osun State Governor, Ademola Adeleke, has restated his rejection of the tribunal judgement and affirmed that he was going to appeal to the higher court. In an address to the people of the state on Friday, Adeleke stated that the discrepancies mentioned in the judgement of the tribunal chairman, Justice Tetsea Kume, were tantamount to a “miscarriage of justice.” He also said the claim of over-voting in the judgement was unfounded. A statement by his spokesperson, Olawale Rasheed, quoting the governor further read in part, “My good people of Osun State, we have all heard the split judgement of the governorship election tribunal. “Two members of the tribunal delivered two opposing  judgements, the chairman and the member one. The member two did not deliver any judgment, she abstained. “The chairman’s judgment affirmed the claim of over-voting, while the member one’s judgement agreed with our position as captured by the BVAS machines, which is the primary source of accreditation data of true accreditation on the day of the election. “The reality of my election as the Governor of Osun State is captured in the member one’s judgement. The claim of over-voting in the chairman’s judgment was  unfounded. This was clearly a miscarriage of justice. Based on the above, there was no majority judgment. “My good people of Osun State, I am still your Governor. I have the right of appeal the chairman’s judgement and I have instructed my lawyers accordingly. “You gave me your mandate, our election remains valid and by the grace of God we will triumph at last. “I call on you all to remain calm and go about your normal activities, peacefully. Please, remain law-abiding. We have strong faith in God and in our judiciary.” The statement also said counsel for Adeleke had filed an appeal against the tribunal judgement. The counsel has “also written the electoral commission intimating it of the appeal and seeking non-implementation of the judgement until the determination of the appeal.”
