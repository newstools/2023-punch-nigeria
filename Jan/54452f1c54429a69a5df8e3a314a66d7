Exactly 228 constables of a total of 10,000 police recruits that passed out on December 29, 2022, resumed duty at the Lagos State Police Command on Thursday, The PUNCH reports. All 228 constables who are of Lagos origin, have been posted to various local government areas, according to the Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin. Hundeyin tweeted on Thursday, “All constables of Lagos State origin, 228 of them, of the 10,000 that graduated from various police training institutions last month, reported for duty today. “All have been posted to their respective LGAs to boost community policing. Welcome onboard, guys.” The PUNCH reports that the Police Service Commission had asked the Accountant-General of the Federation to  halt the capture of 10,000 constables who recently graduated from police training colleges on the Integrated Payroll and Personnel System. The commission stated that the police officers had not been issued their letters of appointment and should not be enrolled on the payment portal. According to the Public Service Rules, public officers not captured on the IPPIS cannot be paid salaries and other emoluments. The development followed the alleged refusal of the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, to submit their names to the PSC for vetting on the grounds that he was empowered by the Police Act, 2020 to recruit constables into the force. The commission has also written to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and the Head of Service, Folasade Yemi-Esan about the enrolment of 20,000 police officers on the salary portal without letters of appointment.
