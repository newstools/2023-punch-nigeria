Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State on Saturday said the Peoples Democratic Party presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, would reopen the nation’s borders if elected at the 2023 general election. The Director-General of the PDP Presidential Campaign Council made the assertion at the PDP campaign rally in Illela Local Government Area of the state. According to him, the PDP presidential candidate has better plans for the country. “These include reopening of the nation’s borders, addressing challenges of insecurity and the provision of basic necessities of life for Nigerians,” he said. The governor added that his administration in the state had a lot of sympathy for the people of Illela being among the worst hit areas by bandits’ attacks. “However, despite challenges of insecurity, economic recession and the negative impact of COVID-19, we have executed several projects under healthcare, education, water supply and social interventions, among others,” he said. In his remarks, the DG, Sokoto Campaign Management Council, Alhaji Yusuf Sulaiman, asked the people of the area to elect continuity in governance by casting their votes for the PDP. The PDP governorship candidate, Malam Sa’idu Umar, pledged that the international market project at Illela would receive the attention it deserved from his administration if elected. Umar said he owed special attention to the people of the state in general. He promised to sustain the legacies of Tambuwal and initiate more developmental projects, if elected. On his part, the Sokoto North senatorial candidate of the PDP and incumbent deputy governor, Alhaji Mannir Dan’iya, attested to the current administration’s successes in the state. He urged the people of the state to reciprocate the gesture by voting for the PDP, adding that many developmental projects were planned for Kware LGA in the 2023 budget. NAN
