The Labour Party’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi, has expressed optimism for the creation of a new Nigeria, noting that previous major political parties had brought more pain than relief to the country. Obi spoke on Wednesday when his presidential campaign council arrived in Gombe State to solicit votes, noting that the solution is in the Labour Party. Our correspondent reports that Obi earlier met with Gombe women at the International Hotel Conference Hall, where he sought their support, stressing that they should use their Permanent Voter Cards to bring the right change to the country. He told participants that, as mothers of the nation, they have a vital role to play by not only participating in politics but also directing their children to vote wisely in the 2023 election. He said, “The 2023 election is an election that will start a new Nigeria that her citizens will begin to trust and have confidence in,” adding that the job of building a new country like Nigeria requires both physical and mental energy. “We want to build a new Nigeria,” he said, adding, “You voted for the umbrella, which leaked and left you suffering; you voted for the broom, which swept you into poverty. “Now is the time to vote for human beings to bring about a new Nigeria. It’s time to vote for mama, papa, and children.”
