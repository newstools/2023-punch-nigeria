Ahead of the general election, the spokesperson for the All Progressives Congress Presidential Campaign Council, Festus Keyamo, has said that the party has the support of Muslims and Christians. Keyamo said the party’s flag bearer, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, would emerge winner at the February presidential poll. Speaking in an interview with Saturday PUNCH, the APC spokesperson said Nigerians were more interested in capacity and competence over religious and tribal sentiments. According to him, Tinubu is the only one that has the capacity to run the affairs of the country. He added that the Muslim-Muslim ticket was considered to provide competency for the nation. “I believe so much that we have both Christians and Muslims support because people are no longer looking at religion but competence and capability and Tinubu is the only one that has that. We are confident that we will win this election with the support of all religions.” Speaking further on the controversy surrounding the health condition of the APC presidential candidate, Keyamo said, “On the health condition of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, there is no basis for it at all. “Asiwaju has been more active than everybody on the campaign. We want to also ask; what is the basis for this suspicion? Has Asiwaju at any time collapsed in public? Did he at any time show any sign of ill-health? “The only time as far as I can remember is when he went for a knee cap operation, which is just to strengthen him the more and after then he has been bouncing all over the place. You can see him climbing chairs going up and down. “So, the issue of health is not a factor against him. If it is against him, which means it will also be against Atiku, who also went for treatment recently in Dubai,” he said.
