The Osun State Police Command on Thursday said it would not tolerate any act capable of causing a crisis in the state, as the Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal, delivers its judgement. The command also said necessary security measures had been put in place to deal decisively, within the ambit of the law, with anyone, or group of persons who may attempt to foment trouble. A statement by the command’s spokesperson, Yemisi Opalola, on Thursday said police, working with other security agencies in the state, would not allow the breakdown of law and order in any part of Osun. It then assured law-abiding residents of adequate security before, during and beyond the judgment. The statement further read in parts, “Osun State Police Command wishes to assure the general public, especially the good people of the state of adequate security before, during and beyond the judgment. “The police in collaboration with other security agencies in the state have put all necessary security measures in place to deal decisively within the ambit of the law with anyone, group of persons who might attempt to foment trouble. “Therefore, the Command is using this medium to appeal to parents and guardians to warn their children and wards to stay out of trouble. “They should not allow themselves to be used by any vicious politicians to cause crisis in the State as the command will not tolerate any kind of thuggery or hooliganism.”
