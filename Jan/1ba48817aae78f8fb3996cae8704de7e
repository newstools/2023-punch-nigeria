Bayero University Kano has debunked a purported fake letter currently in circulation on social media announcing increment in registration fees. A statement issued on Monday by the school’s Deputy Registrar, Public Affairs, Lamara Garba, said the letter was fake. The statement said the university management was yet to decide on any school fees increase as against the social media post being circulated by “unscrupulous elements”. “Students, parents and other stakeholders should note that Bayero University has not yet decided on any school fees increase as against the social media post being circulated by some unscrupulous elements,” the statement said. The university, therefore, urged members of the public to disregard the information as it was fake and malicious.
