The Independent National Electoral Commission has extended the collection of the Permanent Voter Cards by one week. This was disclosed by the National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, on Saturday. This is the second time the commission is extending the collection of PVCs due to the progress recorded so far. The statement read, “The commission met today, Saturday, January 28, 2023, a day after its meeting with the Resident Electoral Commissioners from the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, and deliberated on a number of issues, including the reports from RECs on the ongoing collection of Permanent Voters Cards in its 774 local government offices nationwide. “Having reviewed reports from all the states of the federation, the commission is encouraged by the progress made so far as more Nigerians troop out daily to collect their PVCs. “Arising from reports from the various states and discussions with Resident Electoral Commissioners, the commission has decided to further extend PVC collection in all its local government offices nationwide by an additional one week. “The ongoing collection of PVCs nationwide will therefore continue and end on February 5, 2023. This is the second time the commission is extending PVC collection nationwide and this will be the last extension of the exercise. Collection period has further been extended by an additional two hours and will start at 9am and end at 5pm daily including Saturdays and Sundays. “Those that engaged in double and multiple registrations should not bother visiting any of the commission’s offices as the commission did not print their PVCs.”
