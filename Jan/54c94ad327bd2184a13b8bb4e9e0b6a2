The Federal Government has established an integrated farm estate on 100 hectares of farmland in Sokoto, consisting of an animal husbandry, cow pens and milking parlour, maize and millet plantation, among others. It said the facility, being developed by the National Agricultural Land Development Authority, would sustain itself and reduce the movement of cows within the area and halt clashes between herders and farmers. The Executive Secretary, NALDA,  Paul Ikonne, who inspected the animal husbandry farm on the 100 hectares of land and a poultry feed mill established by the authority, said he was satisfied with the level of work at the facilities. He explained in a statement issued in Abuja on Monday, that the modern animal husbandry had cow pens with capacity of 500 cows, cow milking parlour with capacity of 200 cows in a set, napier grass on 50 hectares, while the construction of clinics/veterinary sections and a training centre were ongoing. “The essence of this is based on Mr. President’s directive to NALDA, which is in line with NALDA’s mandate,” Ikonne stated. He said NALDA was committed to achieving food security and development, adding that the farm would generate employment, hygienic milk production and cow fattening for meat. At the same time, the farm would train and encourage young farmers to go into animal husbandry farming and animal food formulation, according to the NALDA boss. The 100 hectares farm estate is located at Dabagin-lafia, opposite the Usman Danfodio University farm, while the poultry feed mill is situated in Dayin village along the road to Doba, in Sokoto State. “NALDA is into partnership with Prime Ranch Ltd, who donated the 100 hectares of land where we are establishing the animal husbandry farm, napier grass field and will cultivate maize and millet on 30 hectares of the said land,” Ikonne stated.
