A vote for Obi/Dati will restore the lost hope. The two of us are educated, Nigeria should look at the pedigrees and backgrounds of all the candidate and choose the right candidate. We are the most qualify of all the candidate. “2023 is not the turn of anyone but the turn of all Nigeria for credible leadership, it is the turn of Nigeria to take their destiny into thier hands.
