The Founder of Black Wall Street, Charles Lambert, has said that the creation of the Pan African Job Centre will help curb unemployment in Africa by creating over 300 million jobs for youths across the continent. According to a statement, Lambert said that these jobs would be created through the 28 points of the new economic system, compassionate capitalism. Acknowledging that Africa’s biggest challenge was unemployment, Lambert said he hopes the new innovation, the Pan African Job Centre, would process African youths into jobs in the 28 sectors after getting certificates following an intense training programme. “The job centre is already implemented on the platform online and will soon be implemented physically offline with actual physical setup across various African countries,” Lambert said. He added that this development would aid in building industries to help control production. “It is not a secret that we are the richest continent in the world.” All these, Lambert added, would be made possible by working with Indians to help bring the over 300 million youths into the job ranks within the compassionate capitalism 28 sectors.
