A former Minister of Transportation, Idris Umar, has said that Nigeria is in a sorry state, adding that the people are tired of the misrule of the All Progressives Congress-led government. He said people had become optimistic about the need for positive change, stressing that the Peoples Democratic Party would deliver good governance. Umar, who was a minister under former President Goodluck Jonathan’s administration, said, “Under the APC administration, insecurity has become the order of the day; kidnapping, raping, banditry have become norms and rural dwellers who are farmers can longer go the farm freely.” The former minister made disclosure in Deba, Yamaltu-Deba Local Government Area during the PDP campaign for its Gombe Central candidates. He called on youths, women and small scale business owners to elect the presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar, saing he (Atiku) had plans to use N7tn to empower and support them. Meanwhile, the immediate past Public Relations Officer of PDP in Gombe State, Murtala Dukku, has defected to the New Nigeria Peoples Party. He joined the opposition NNPP after his resignation from the PDP. Recall that Dukku was suspended by the PDP via a letter dated 22nd December 2022, signed by the state PDP Secretary, Adamu Abubakar, accusing him of working against the party. He, however, resigned from the party barely two hours after his suspension through a letter addressed to the party leadership Usman, officially dumped the PDP for the NNPP on Wednesday January 12th, 2023.
