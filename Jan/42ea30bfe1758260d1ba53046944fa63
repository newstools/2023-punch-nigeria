Bayelsa State Governor Douye Diri has said the Peoples Democratic Party wants the five aggrieved governors of the party back to the PDP. Duoye said this when he met with the Edo State Governor Mr. Godwin Obaseki, and his Delta State counterpart, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, on Tuesday, for over three hours to strategise and ensure the PDP’s victory in the forthcoming presidential election. Governor Diri, who spoke on the position of the G-5 govs (Nyesom Wike – Rivers, Samuel Ortom -Benue, Seyi Makinde – Oyo, Okezie Ikpeazu – Abia and Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State), said the party was not ruling out discussing with them to persuade them to return, support and work for the victory of the party’s candidate, Atiku Abubakar. “We want a united PDP and each time we meet, we focus and discuss the unity. We are not ruling out speaking to our brothers even today, we have also discussed the possibility of speaking to them to return to our party. “We are calling on our brother-governors to be part of their own party and work in unity with every other person. We still want our brother governors back so we can visit them the way we visited our brother, Governor Okowa who by God’s grace will be the Vice-President of Nigeria,” Diri added. Emerging from the meeting held at Delta State Governor’s residence at Owa Alero in Delta State, Governor Obaseki said the meeting was to felicitate with the party’s vice-presidential candidate and to wish him well in the election. “It is a new year. We go round facilitating as a family to wish each other well and pray the new year brings good tidings to the party. We are here today to visit our brother, Sen. Ifeanyi Okowa, Governor of Delta State and vice-presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the 2023 presidential election. “We wish him well in this election year and by the grace of God, he will be the next VP of Nigeria. We pray God Almighty will make our dreams come through this 2023.”
