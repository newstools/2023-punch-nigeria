A member of the Peoples Democratic Party Board of Trustees, Alphonsus Nwosu, has resigned from the party. He cited the party’s failure to respect its power rotation/ zoning principle as the reason for his action, contained in his letter of resignation cited by our correspondent on Friday. The letter, dated January 12, 2023, was addressed to the national chairman of the party, Iyorchia Ayu, and the acting chairman of the BoT, Adolphus Wabara. It partly read, “I hereby resign my membership of the Peoples Democratic Party and its Board of Trustees with effect from today Thursday 12th January, 2023, “This resignation for me is a matter of conscience and principle because of the Party’s inability to adhere to the rotation provision in its (PDP) constitution. “The journey to rotational presidency between the North and South of Nigeria has been a long and arduous one and I have been involved.” Nwosu added that PDP “must learn” to respect the provisions in its constitution and the agreement reached by members of the party. Nigeria and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) must learn to keep to an agreement reached by a Constituent Assembly (1995), and enshrined in the Party’s (PDP) Constitution (1998),” Nwosu maintained. Nwosu served as Minister of Health during the administration of Ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo administration from 1999-2007.
