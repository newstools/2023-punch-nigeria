The Zamfara State Peoples Democratic Party governorship candidate, Dauda Lawal, has denied allegations that the party’s campaign rallies in the state were violent. This was as he claimed the ruling All Progressive Congress in the state was jittery over the support and popularity his party was enjoying. Lawal, who stated this in Gusau on Saturday, denounced allegations that the PDP in the state had sponsored thugs to disrupt peace and unleash mayhem during the campaign and political rallies. Governor Bello Matawalle had vowed that thugs caught with AK-47 rifles and other dangerous weapons during a political rally in the state earlier in the week, must be brought to book. Matawalle while addressing newsmen at his country home in Maradun town, Maradun Local Government Area of the state, on Friday, said only security operatives were empowered by law to carry AK-47 rifles or any other sophisticated weapon. “I wonder what civilians could be doing with AK-47 rifles or other dangerous weapons if they are not terrorists,” he added. However, the PDP governorship candidate who spoke through Dauda Lawal Media Office described the allegation as “a lie that lacks any substance.” He said, “Our attention has been drawn to a press release given by the Zamfara State Commissioner of Security and Home Affairs accusing the PDP of sponsoring thugs to destabilise political rallies in the state. We are not surprised because the APC in Zamfara is well known for deliberate distortion and doctoring of facts. “The Zamfara government is confused and jittery over the overwhelming support and popularity the PDP is enjoying, especially the gale of defection that is wrecking the APC in the state. “Our campaign and rallies are peaceful and will continue within the ambit of the law. “We urge our supporters to continue to be law-abiding at all times.”
