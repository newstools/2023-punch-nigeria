The presidential candidate of the Peoples Redemption Party, Kola Abiola, has threatened to deal decisively with secessionists if elected Nigerian president on February 25, 2023. He made this known in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, at a presidential parley organised by the South-West Development Stakeholders Forum. Abiola declared that their action was unconstitutional and amounted to treason. The PRP Presidential candidate insisted that he would not accept any action that would threaten the unity of Nigeria if elected, saying his administration would encourage them if only it would not affect the unity of Nigeria.
