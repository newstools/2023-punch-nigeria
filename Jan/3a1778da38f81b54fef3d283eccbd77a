The Executive Director, Esan Youth for Good Governance and Social Justice, Benson Odia, on Monday, said the alleged kidnappers who abducted passengers at the Tom Ikimi Train Station in Igueben, Edo State on Saturday had made contact with some families of the kidnap victims and demanded N20 million for each victim. Odia said the demand was absurd, calling on the authorities to intensify efforts in rescuing the 31 abducted persons that are still being held captive by their abductees. He also said that the Minister of Transportation and the Nigeria Railway Corporation boss were at Igueben to assess the situation themselves. Odia said the authorities promised to engage the use of a helicopter on Tuesday in an effort to locate where the victims were kept in the bush. He said, “I can tell you that the kidnappers have demanded N20 million, totalling N620 million. This is absurd and I don’t know where poor people will be able to raise that amount of money. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer for the state command, Chidi Nwabuzor, said he would confirm the veracity of the claim.
