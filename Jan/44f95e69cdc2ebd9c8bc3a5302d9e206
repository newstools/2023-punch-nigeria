Napoli has nominated Victor Osimhen’s goal celebration among the best for 2022. Osimhen has a lot to celebrate in the outgoing year after returning fully from a freak cheek fracture that required surgery and kept him out of the Africa Cup of Nations in January. The 24-year-old welcomed the birth of his first daughter in October and shortly after became the most prolific Nigerian footballer to ever play in the Italian Serie A. The former Wolfsburg star currently sits atop the league scorer’s chart as his nine goals are equaled or bettered by no other. Osimhen’s celebration for two of those goals has however received special recognition after they were nominated for the club’s end-of-the-year awards. In the first, Victor Osimhen and Frank Anguissa were involved in a lovely dance routine after Napoli scored a goal against Hellas Verona. On the other, Osimhen went with the wild celebration after netting the winner for his side in the away clash with AS Roma. That goal itself is in the running for Napoli’s best goal of the year award while Osimhen has one of his two assists of the 2022-23 season nominated for the assist of the year award.
