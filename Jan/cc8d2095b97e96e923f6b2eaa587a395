The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Tuesday, said there was currently 100 per cent broadband penetration across the country. Buhari disclosed this at the maiden Digital Economy Conference of the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture, held at the Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry complex. Speaking through the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Isah Patami, the President said reports that claimed the country had achieved only 43 per cent broadband penetration were obsolete. “One of the most richest persons in the world announced that Nigeria, out of the 54 African countries, has outstanding broadband penetration. As I speak to you today, the broadband penetration in Nigeria is 100 per cent,” Buhari stated. He explained that from  23 per cent coverage in 2019, the Federal Government had increased the broadband penetration by 77 per cent to 100 per cent in 2023. “As of today, broadband can be accessed everywhere in the country, whether in the urban area, rural area or desert. We are the first African country to attain this and the only one so far,” the President stated. This came as the President revealed that the communication ministry’s quarterly revenue had grown considerably, adding that “we we moved from generating N51bn in three months to N408bn in three months.” The National President, NACCIMA, John Udeagbala, said the conference was put together to promote the technology ecosystem, establish potentials of digital economy for job creation, and identify opportunities that exist in the tech industry in Nigeria.
