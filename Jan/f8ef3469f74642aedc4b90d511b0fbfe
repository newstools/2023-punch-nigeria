The Commissioner of Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises Development, Sa’adatu Bello Kirfi, has resigned her appointment hours after her father was stripped of his traditional title as Wazirin Bauchi and removed as Bauchi Emirate Council member. The PUNCH earlier reported that Kirfi, a retired federal civil servant, Second Republic Minister and former Minister of Special Duties was for the second time in five years, stripped of his traditional title and removed from office as a Senior Member of the Bauchi Emirate Council. He was removed over his alleged “disloyalty and disrespect” to the State Governor, Bala Mohammed. His removal was conveyed in a letter addressed to him by the Secretary of the Bauchi Emirate Council, Alh. Shehu Mudi Muhammad, dated January 3rd, 2023 with reference No: BEC/ADM/20/VOL.XV and titled: “Removal from office as a Council Member and Traditional Title of Wazirin Bauchi.” He was first removed by the Bauchi Emirate Council in March 2017 for alleged “disloyal and unruly behavior” during the administration of Governor Mohammed Abubakar. But Sa’adatu, who is one of the children of the octogenarian, tendered her resignation as a Commissioner in the Bala Mohammed administration and member of the State Executive Council after his father stripped of his title. Her resignation was contained in a terse letter addressed to the governor through the Secretary to the State Government, dated January 4, 2023 and titled “Letter of Resignation.” “Your Excellency, I wish to humbly tender my resignation as a member, Bauchi State Executive Council and Hon. Commissioner Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs Development, Bauchi State with immediate effect. “I wish to thank His Excellency the Executive Governor for giving me the opportunity to serve my State under your Administration,” she wrote in her letter.
